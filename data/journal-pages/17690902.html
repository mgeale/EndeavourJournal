        Very Strong gales with heavy Squalls of Wind, hail and rain. At 4 <small>PM</small> <sub>^</sub><sup>being in the Lat<sup>d</sup> of 40&deg; 22' S<sup>o</sup> and</sup> having not the least Visi<strike>a</strike>ble signs of Land, we wore and brought too und<sub>^</sub><sup>er</sup> the fore sail and reefd the Main sail and handed it. I did intend to have stood to the Southward, if the winds had been moderate so long as they continued Westerly <sub>^</sub><sup>notwithstanding we had no prospect of meeting with land, rather than stand back to y<sup>e</sup> north<sup>rd</sup> on the same track as we came</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;but as the weather <strike>is</strike> <sub>^</sub><sup>was</sup> so very tempestuous I <sub>^</sub><sup>laid a side this design</sup>, <strike>thought</strike> thinking it <strike>the</strike> more advisable to stand to the Northward in <strike>hope of meeting with</strike> <sub>^</sub><sup>into</sup> better weather least we should receive such damages in our sails &amp; rigging as might hinder the further prosecutions of the Voyage &#151;

At Noon the weather was more Moderate&nbsp;&nbsp; set the reef'd Main sail, a great Sea from the <small>WSW</small> &#151;
