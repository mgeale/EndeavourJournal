        The first part of these 24 hours Moderate breezes and  clowdy &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the remainder fresh gales and clowdy, <small>PM</small>  saw a great many Albetrosses and other Birds about the Ship, some were all white  and about the Size of Teal&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;Took several observations of the  Sun and Moon, the result of which gave 90&deg;..13' West Longitude from Greenwich-  &nbsp;the Variation of the Compass by the Mean of several Az<sup>th</sup>  17&deg; East &#151;&nbsp;The Longitude by account is less then that by Obser<sup>n</sup>  37' which is about 20 Miles in these high Latitudes, and nearly equall to the  Error of the Logg Line before mentioned: this near agreement of the two Longitudes  proves to a demonstration that we have had no Western current sence we left  the Land &#151;
        
        <p>
        
        From the foregoing observations it will appear that  we are now advanced about 12&deg; to the westward of the Strait of Magellan  and 3<small>1/2</small>&deg; to the northward of it,, having been 33 days in doubbling  Cape Horn or the land of Terra del Fuego, and arriving into the degree of Latitude  and Longitude we are now in <strike>and</strike> without ever  being brought once under our close reefe'd Topsails since we left Strait La  Maire a circumstance that perhaps never happen'd before to any Ship in those  seas so much dreaded for hard gales of wind insomuch that the doubling of Cape  Horn is thought by some to be a mighty thing and others to this Day prefer the  Straits of Magellan. &nbsp;&nbsp;as I have never been in those Straits, can  only form my judgement on a carefull comparrison of the different Ships Journals  that have pass'd them and those that have sail'd round Cape Horn particularly  the Dolphins two Last Voyages and this of ours being made at the same Season  of the Year when one may reasonably expect the Same winds to prevail. The Dolphin  in her last Voyage was 3 Months in geting through the Straits not reckoning  the time she lay in Port Famine, and I am firmly per<strike>a</strike>swa<strike>i</strike>ded  from the winds we have had, that had we came<strike>'d</strike>  by that passage we should not have been in these Seas; besides the fatiguing  of our people the Damage we must have done to our Anchors Cables Sails and Rigging  none of which have suffered in our passage round Cape Horn &#151;

        From what I have said it will appear that I am no advocate  for the Straits of Magellan, but it may be expected that I should say some thing  of Strait le Maire through which we pass'd - and this is the more incumbant  on me as it was by choise and contrary to the advice <strike>of</strike>  <sub>^</sub> <sup>given by</sup> M<sup>r</sup>  Walter the ingenious Author of Lord Ansons Voyage who adveiseth all Ships not  to go through this Strait but to go to the Eastward of Staten land, and likewise  to stand to the Southward as far as 61&deg; or 62&deg; South before any endeavour  is made to get to the westward; with respect to the passing of Strait Le Maire  or going round Staten land, I look upon of little consequence and either one  or the other to be pursue'd according to circumstances: for if you happen to  fall in with the land to the westward of the Strait and the winds favourable  for going through it certainly must be a peice of folly to loose time in going  round Staten land for by paying a little attention to the directions I have  already given no ill concequences can attend; but, on the contrary if you should  fall in with the land to the eastward of the Strait or the wind should prove  boisterous, or unfavourable, in any of these cases the going to the Eastward  of Staten land is the most adviseable--&nbsp;&nbsp; And next, as to runing into  the Latitude of 61&deg; or 62&deg; South before any endeavour is made to get  to the westward, is what I think no man will ever do that can avoide it, for  it cannot be suppose'd that any one will Stear South mearly to get into a high  Latitude when at the same time he can Steer west, for it is not Southing but  Westing thats wanting, but this way you cannot steer because the winds blow  almost constantly from that quarter, so that you have no other choise but to  stand to the Southward, close upon a wind, and by keeping upon that Tack you  not only make southing but westing also and sometimes not a little when the  wind Varies to the northward of west, and the farther you advance to the South<sup>rd</sup>  the better chance you have of having the winds from that quarter or Easterly  and likewise <strike>with</strike> <sub>^</sub>  <sup>of</sup> meeting with finer weather.&nbsp;&nbsp; both  of which we ourselves experence'd. Prudence will direct every man when in those  high Latitudes to make sure of Sufficient westing <sub>^</sub>  <sup>to double all the lands</sup> before he thinks of Standing  to the Northward. When the winds was westerly the mountains on Terra Del Fuego  were generally cover'd with dense clowds, formed as one may reasonably suppose  by watery exhalations and by vapours brought thither by the westerly winds:  for from that quarter came frequent showers of Rain, Hail and Snow, and after  we had left the land and <strike>was</strike> were standing  to the Southward with the winds westerly dark dense clouds were continuely forming  in the horizon and rose to about 45&deg; where they began to disspate, these  were generally attended with showers of rain or hail and Sq<sup>ls</sup>  of Wind; but as we advanced to the southward these clowds became less dence,  and in y<sup>e</sup> Lat<sup>d</sup>  of 60&deg;..10', where we got the winds Easterly <sub>^</sub>  <sup>the weath<sup>r</sup> </sup>was  more serene and milder, again as we advanced to the northward we had a constant  clowded sky &amp; dark gloomy weather, y<sup>e</sup> whole  time exceed<sup>g</sup> cold -
