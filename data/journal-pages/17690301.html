        First part fresh breeze, the remainder, moderate breezes and clear weather. The result of the forementioned Observations gives 110&deg;..33' W<sup>t</sup>. Longitude from Greenwich and exactly agrees with the Longitude given by the Log, from Cape Horn: this agreement of the two Longitudes after a Run of 660 leagues is surpriseing and much more then could be expected; but as it is so, it serves to prove as well as the repeted trials we have made when the weather would permit, that we have had no current that hath affected the Ship Since we came into these Seas, this must be <sub>^</sub> <sup>a</sup> great sign that we have been near no land of any extent, because near land are generally found currents; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is well known that on the East side of the Continent in the North sea we meet with Currents above 100 Leagues from the Land, and even in the Middle of the Atlantic Ocean between Africa and America are always found currents, and I can see no reason why currents should not be found in this Sea Supposing a Continent or lands lay not <sub>^</sub> <sup>far </sup>west from us <sub>^</sub> <sup>as</sup> some have immagine'd, and if such land<strike>s</strike> was ever seen we cannot be far from it, as we are now 5<strike>0</strike>60 Leagues West of the Coast of Chili &#151;
