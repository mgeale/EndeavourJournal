        Friday 2<sup>d</sup> In the <small>PM</small> the gale increased to a storm attended with rain and squalls which came <sub>^</sub><sup>down</sup> in excessive heavy gusts from off the high land, in one of which the hawser we had fast to the <sub>^</sub><sup>Shore</sup> brok &nbsp;this obliged us to let go another anchor. Towards midnight the gale moderated and in the morning it fell calm and we took up the Sheet anchor look'd at the best bower and moor'd the Ship again to the shore. The heavy rains which hath fell and still continues to fall hath the caused the brook we water'd at to over flow its banks and carry away ten small Casks we had standing there full of water and not withstanding we searched the whole Cove we could not find one of them.
