        Monday 17<sup>th</sup> Winds Easterly a fresh breeze with which we Steer'd <small>WNW</small> untill 2 o'Clock when being pretty near the North end of <u>Rotte</u> we hauld up <small>NNW</small> in order to go between it and <u>Anabo</u>a, after steering 3 Leagues upon this Course we edge'd away <small>NW</small> and west and by 6 oClock we were clear of all the Islands, at this time the South part of <u>Anabo</u>a, which lies in the Latitude of 10&deg;..15' S<sup>o</sup> bore <small>NE</small> &#151; distant 4 <strike>or 5</strike> Leag<sup>s</sup> and the Island of <u>Rott</u>e extending as far to the Southward as S<sup>o</sup> 36&deg; West. The North end of this Island and the south end of Timor lies <small>N<small>1/2</small>E</small> and <small>S<small>1/2</small>W</small>, distant about 3 or 4 Leag<sup>s</sup> from each other &#151; At the West end of the Passage between R<u>ot</u>te and A<u>nab</u>oa are two small Islands, the one lays near the Rotte shore and the other off the <small>SW</small> point of Anaboa, there is a good Channell between the two of 5 or 6 Miles broad which we came through &#151;

        Being now clear of the Islands we steer'd a west Course all night untill 6 o'clock in the Morning when we unexpectedly saw an Island bearing <small>WSW</small>, for by the most of the Maps we had on board we were to the southward of all the Islands that lay between <u>Timo</u>r and <u>Jav</u>a, at least there were none laid down so near to Timor in this Latitude by almost one half which made me at first think it a new discovery but in this I was Mistaken. We now steer'd directly for it and by 10 oClock were close in with the North side <strike>of it</strike> where we saw Houses, Cocoa-nutt Trees and Flocks of Cattle grazing. &nbsp;&nbsp;these were temtations hardly to be withstood by people in our Situation, especially such as were but in a very indifferent state of health and I may say mind too, for in some this last was worse than the other sence I refuse'd to touch at the Island of Timor. Wherefore I thought I could not do less than to try to procure some refres[h]ments here as there appear'd to be plenty; with this View we hoisted out the Pinnace in which I sent Lieut<sup>t</sup> Gore in shore to see if there were any convenient place to land, <strike>giving him&nbsp;</strike><sub>^</sub><sup>sending</sup> some trifles along with him to give to the Natives in case he saw any &#151;
        
        <p>
        
        M<sup>r</sup> Gore Landed in a small sandy Cove near to some houses and was met on the beach by 8 or 10 of the Natives who both from their behavour and what they had about them shew'd that they had commerce with Europeans, upon M<sup>r</sup> Gore's returning with this report and like wise that there was no anchorage for the Ship I sent him away again with both Mony and goods to try to purchas some refreshments while we kept standing on and off with the Ship &#151;
        
        <p>
        
        At Noon we were about a Mile from the Shore of the Island which extend[ed] from <small>SE</small> to <small>WNW</small>. Latitude in 10&deg;..27', Long<sup>de</sup> 237&deg;..31' West
