        A Steady breeze and fine pleasant weather. This afternoon by the mean of several Azimuths and the Amplitude found the Variation to be 0&deg;.. 34' East, from which it appears that about the foregoing Noon we have cross'd the line of no variation in the Lat<sup>d</sup> of 10&deg;. 38' <small>S</small> and according to the following observations, in 32&deg;. 0' West Long<sup>d</sup> from Greenwich. At 5h.. 5'.. 0" Apparent time <small>AM</small> the long<sup>d</sup> of the Ship, per observation of the <img src="../../gifs/moon.gif" width="23" height="20"> and the<img src="../../gifs/star.gif" width="20" height="12"> Aldebaran was found to be 32&deg;.. 0'.. 45". At 8<sup>h</sup> 17' 0" per sun and moon 32&deg; 25' 0"; and at 9<sup>h</sup> 0' 6" - 32&deg; 19' 0". Mean of the three is 32&deg; 14' 55". And again at 7<sup>h</sup> 12' 52" per <img src="../../gifs/sun.gif" width="22" height="20"> and <img src="../../gifs/moon.gif" width="23" height="20">, 32&deg;.. 10'.. 4", and at 7<sup>h</sup>.. 19'.. 42" per <img src="../../gifs/sun.gif" width="22" height="20">and <img src="../../gifs/moon.gif" width="23" height="20">, 32&deg;.. 15'.. 20"; the mean of these two is 32&deg;.. 12'.. 42" and the mean of the Whole is 32&deg;.. 13'.. 43" West from Greenwich which is less by a whole degree than that by account which is a considerable error to be made in five day in these low latitudes, one would think from this that we must have had a current seting to the Eas[t]ward, which is not likely that it should set againist the settled trade wind. The three first of these observations were made by M<sup>r</sup> Green and the two last by myself.
