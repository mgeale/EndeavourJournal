        Fresh gales from the <small>SSW</small>  with Squally rainy W<sup>r</sup> with which we stood to  the Westward. in the evening some people thought they saw the appearence of  land to the Northward &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this appear'd so improbable that  I who was not on deck at this time was not acquainted with it untill dark, when  I order'd them to sound but found no ground with 80 f<sup>m</sup>  upon which we concluded that no land was near but day light in the Morning <strike>shew'd  us our error</strike> proved this to be a Mistake by shewing us the land at the  Distance of a bout 2 Leagues off. We had now the wind at <small>SE</small>,  blowing fresh right upon the land &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we made the land we  were standing to the westward but thinking the other the best tack to get off  on we wore and hauld off to Eastward and by now had got an offing of a bout  4 Leagues &nbsp;the land at this time extending from <small>NEBN</small>  to <small>WSW</small> &nbsp;&nbsp;This part of the Coast  of Africa that we fell in with lies in about the Latitude of 3<strike>4</strike><sup>2</sup>&deg;.<strike>54</strike>0'  and Longitude of 331&deg;..29'W<sup>t</sup> / 28&deg;..  31'E<sup>t</sup>: and near to what is call'd in the Charts  Point Natall, it was a steep cragy point very much broke and look'd as if the  high Cragy rocks were Islands.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the <small>NE</small>  of this point the land in gener<sup>l</sup> appeared to  rise sloaping from the Sea <sub>^</sub><sup>to  a moderate height</sup> the shore Alternately Rocks and Sand, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About  2 Leagues to the <small>NE</small> of the point, appeared  to be the Mouth of a River which probably may be that of S<sup>t</sup>  Johns &#151; At this time the weather was very Hazey so that we had but a very  imperfect View of the land which did not appear to great advantage &#151;
