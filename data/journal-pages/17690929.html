At 11 <small>AM</small> saw a Bird something like a snipe only it had a short Bill, it had the appearence of a land bird, Several Albetroses, Pintado Birds, and sheer-waters about the Ship, and a number of Doves, of these we have seen more or less ever since the 31<sup>st</sup> of last month the day we first saw them &#151;
