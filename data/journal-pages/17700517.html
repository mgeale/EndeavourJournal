        Thursday 17<sup>th</sup> Winds southerly mostly a fresh breeze with which <sub>^</sub><sup>in the <small>PM</small></sup> we steer'd along shore <small>N<small>3/4</small>E</small> at the distance of about 2 Leagues off. Between 4 and 5 we discoverd breakers on our larboord bow &nbsp;&nbsp;our depth of water at this time was 37 fathom - At sun set the northermost land in sight bore <small>NBW</small>, the breakers <sup><small>NW</small></sup><small>BW</small> distant 4 Miles and the northermost land set at noon &nbsp;&nbsp;which form'd a point which I nam'd Point lookout bore west <sup><sub>^</sub>distant 5 or 6 Miles</sup> / Latitude 2<strike>7</strike>8&deg; 6' / <strike>Longitude 20&deg;&nbsp;&nbsp;' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to</strike> <sub>^</sub><sup>On</sup> the north<strike>ward</strike> <sup>side</sup> of this point the shore forms a wide open Bay <sub>^</sub><sup>which I have named Morton bay</sup> in the bottom of which the land is so low that I could but just see it from the <sub>^</sub><sup>top</sup> mast head. &nbsp;&nbsp;the breakers I have mentioned lies about 3 or 4 Miles from Point Lookout, &nbsp;at this time we had a great sea from the south ward which broke prodigious high upon them. Stood on <small>NNE</small> untill 8 oClock when being past the breakers and having depen'd our water to 52 fathom we brought too untill 12 oClock than made sail again to the <small>NNE</small> at 4 in the <sup>AM</sup> we sounded and 135 f<sup>m</sup> At day light I found that we had in the night got much farther to the northward and from the shore than I expected from the Course we steerd for we were at least 6 or 7 Leagues <sub>^</sub><sup>off</sup> <strike>from the land</strike> and therefore haul'd in <sup><small>NW</small></sup><small>BW</small> having the advantage of a Fresh Gale at <small>S<sup>SW</sup></small>, the northermost land seen last night bore from us at this time <small>S<sup>SW</sup></small> distant 6 Leagues <sub>^</sub>T<sup>his land I named C. Morton it being the N Point of the Bay <strike>of the Bay of the</strike> </sup>of the Bay of the the same name / Lat<sup>de</sup> 26&deg; 56' / Long<sup>d</sup> 206&deg; 28' / From C. Morton the Land trends away west farther than we could see for there is <sub>^</sub><sup>a</sup> small space where we could see no land some on board was of opinion that there is a River there because the Sea lookd p<sub>^</sub><sup>a</sup>ler than usual, upon sounding we found <strike>but</strike> 34 fathom water a fine white sandy bottom which a lone is sufficeint [to] change the apparant colour of sea water without the assistance of Rivers &nbsp;&nbsp;the land need only <strike>have</strike> to be a[s] low here as it is in a thousand other places upon the coast to have made it impossible for us to have seen it at the distance we were off. &nbsp;&nbsp;be this as it may it was a point that could not be clear'd up as we had the wind, but should any one be desirous of do[ing] it that may come after me this place may always be found by three hills which lay to the northward <sub>^</sub><sup>of it</sup> in the Latitude of 26&deg;..53' S<sup>o</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;these hills lay but a little way inland and not far from each other, they are very remarkable on account of there singlar form of elivation which very much resemble glass houses which occasioned my giving them that name, &nbsp;&nbsp;the northermost of the three is the highest and largest, there are likewise several other peaked hills inland to the northward of these but they are not near so remarkable &#151; At Noon we were by Obs<sup>n</sup> in the Latitude of 26&deg;..28' S<sup>o</sup> which was 10 Miles to the northward of the log a circumstance that hath not hapend sence we have been upon the coast before &nbsp;&nbsp;our course and distance run sence yesterday noon was <small>NBW</small>, 80 Miles which brought us into the Long<sup>de</sup> of 206&deg;..46 &nbsp;&nbsp;At this time we were about 2 or 3 Leagues from the land and <sub>^</sub><sup>in</sup> 24 fathom water - A low bluff point which was the south point of an open sandy bay bore N 62&deg; W<sup>t</sup> distant 3 Leagues and the northermost point of land in sight bore <small>N<small>1/4</small>E</small> &#151; Several smooks Seen today and some pretty far inland &#151;
