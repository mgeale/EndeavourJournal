        Friday 26<sup>th</sup> Gentle breezes and pleasent weather. In the <small>PM</small> I made a little excursion in the Pinnace along shore towards the mouth of the inlet, accompanied by M<sup>r</sup> Banks and D<sup>r </sup>Solander; we found in a small cove several of the Natives of whome we purchas'd a quantity of fresh fish, and upon our return to the Ship found that the Saine had been equally as successfull. which we generally haul mornings &amp; evenings, and seldom fail of geting fish sufficient to serve all hands. In the <small>AM</small> I made an excursion into one of the Bays which lie on the East side of the <sub>^</sub><sup>Inlet</sup> accompanied by M<sup>r</sup> Banks and D<sup>r</sup> Solander &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon our landing we ascended a very high hill from which we had a full View of the passage I had before descover'd and the land on the opposite shore which appear'd to be about 4 Leagues from us, but as it was hazey near the horizon we could not see far to the <small>SE</small>. However I had now seen enough of this passage to convence me that there was the greatest probabillty in the world of its runing into the Eastern Sea as the distance <strike>from one</strike> <sup>of that</sup> Sea <strike>to the other at</strike> <sub>^</sub><sup>from</sup> this place cannot exceed 20 Leagues <sub>^</sub> <sup>even to where we were, upon this I resolv'd after puting to sea</sup> <strike>and therefore after leaving the place we are in I intend</strike> to search this passage with the Ship. We found on the top of the hill a parcel of loose Stones of which we built a Pyrmid and left in it some Musquet balls, small <sub>^</sub><sup>Shott</sup> Beeds and what ever we had about us that was likely to stand the test of time: after this we <strike>descen</strike> descended the hill and found along with <strike>Tobia</strike> Tupia and the boats crew several of the natives, seting in the most free and friendly manner imaginable. T<strike>ob</strike>upia always accompanies <sub>^</sub><sup>us</sup> in every excursion we make and proves of infinate service <strike>to us</strike>. In our return to the ship we Visited the Hippa we had seen on Tuesday last which is situated on a small Island or rather a Rock, the Inhabitants of this place invited us a shore with their usual marks of friendship and shew'd us all over the place which indeed was soon done, for it was very small yet it contain'd a good number of people and they had in it <sub>^</sub><sup>split &</sup> hanging up to dry a prodigious quantity of various sorts of small fish a part of which they sold to us for such trifles as we had about us &#151;
