        Saturday 2<sup>nd</sup> Winds at <small>SSE</small> and <small>SE</small> a gentle breeze, with which we stood to the <small>NW</small> and <small>NWBN</small> as the land lay under an easy sail having a boat ahead sounding; our soundings at first w<strike>as</strike>ere very erregular from 9 to 4 fathoms, but afterwards regular from 9 to 11 fathom &#151; At 8 oClock being about two Leagues from the Main Land we anchor'd in 11 fathom sandy bottom - soon after this we found a Slow motion of a tide seting to the westward - At 1 oClock it was Slack <sub>^</sub><sup>or low</sup> water and at <small>1/2</small> past 2 oClock the Ship tended to the Eastward and and rode so untill 6 at which time <strike>we anchor'd</strike> the tide had risen 11 feet, We now got under Sail and Stood away <small>NNW</small> as the land lay. From the observations made on the tides last night it is plain that the flood comes from the <small>NW</small>- whereas yesterday and for several days before we found it to come <strike>always</strike> from the <small>SE</small>. &nbsp;&nbsp;this is neither the first nor second time that we have observed the same thing and in my opinion easy accounted for but this I shall do in another place - At Sun rise we found the Variation to be 6&deg;..45' East. In ste<strike>a</strike>ering along shore between the Island and the Main at the <sub>^</sub><sup>distance</sup> of 2 Leagues from the latter and 3 or 4 from the former - our sounding were regular from 12 to 9 fathom but about a 11 oClock we w<strike>as</strike>ere again embarrased with Shoal water but got clear without leting go an Anchor, we had at one time not quite 3 fathom. At Noon we were about 2 Leagues from the Main land and about 4 from the Islands without us - our Latitude by observation was 20&deg;..56' Longitude made from Cape Palmerston 16&deg; West &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pretty high Promontary which I named Cape <u>Hillsboro</u>ugh bore <small>W<small>1/2</small>N</small> distant 7 Miles - the Mainland is here pretty much deversified with Mountains, Hills plains and Vallies and seems to be tolerably cloathed with wood and Verdure &nbsp;&nbsp;the Islands which lay parallel with the Coast and from 5 to 8 or 9 Leagues off are of Various extent both for height and circuit, hardly any exceeds 5 Leagues in circuit and many again are very small besides this chain of Islands which lay at a distance from the coast there are other small ones laying <strike>scatterd</strike> under the land. Some few smooks were seen on the Mainland &#151;
