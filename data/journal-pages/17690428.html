        Friday, 28<sup>th</sup> This Morning <strike>Several</strike> <sub>^</sub> <sup>a great number</sup> of the Natives came to us in their Canoes from different parts of the Island several of whome we had not seen before&nbsp;&nbsp; one of these was the Woman called by the Dolphins the Queen of this Island, She first went to M<sup>r</sup> Banks's Tent at the Fort where she was not known till the Master happening to go aShore who knew<strike>ed</strike> her and brought her on board with two men and several Women who seem'd to be all of her Family. &nbsp;I made them all some presents or other, but to Obariea, for such is this womans name, I gave several things, in return for which, as soon as I went a Shore with her, she gave me a Hog and several Bunches of Plantains, these she caused to be carried from her Canoe's up to the Fort in a kind of a Procession, she and I bringing up the rear. This Woman is about 40 years of Age and like most of the other Women very Masculine- &nbsp;she is head or Chief of her own Family or Tribe but to all appearence hath no authority over the rest of the Inhabitants whatever she might have <sub>^</sub> <sup>had</sup> when the Dolphin was here. Hercules, whose real Name is Tootaha, is to all appearences the Chief man of the Island and hath generally Viseted us twice a week sence we have been here, and came always attended by a number of Canoes and people, and at those times we <strike>was</strike> <sup>were</sup> sure to have a supply, more or less, of every thing the Island afforded; both from him self and from those that came with him - and it is a Chance thing that we got a Hog at any other time, &nbsp;he was with us at this time and did not appear very well pleased at the notice we took of Obariea &#151; but I soon but him into a good humor by takeing him on board and makeing him some presents
