        Tuesday 16<sup>th</sup> Variable light airs and clear settled weather. At 1 <small>PM</small> hauled close round the <small>SW</small> end of the Island on which stands the Village before mentioned the inhabitants of which were all in arms - At 2 oClock we Anchor'd in a very snug Cove which is on the <small>NW</small> side of the Bay faceing the S<sup>o</sup> West end of the Island, in 11 fath. water soft ground and moor'd with the Stream anchor. By this time several of the Natives had come off to the Ship in their canoes and after <sub>^</sub><sup>heaving a few stones at us and having</sup> some conversation with T<strike>obia</strike><sup>upia</sup> some of them venture'd on board where they made but a very short stay before they went into their boats again and soon after left us altogether. I then went a Shore in the bottom of the Cove accompanied by most of the Gentlemen, we found a fine stream of excellent water, and as to Wood the land is here one intire forest - having the Saine with us we made a few hauls and caught 300 pounds weight of different sorts of fish which <strike>was</strike> were equally distributd to the Ships Compney. <small>AM</small> Careend the Ship scrub'd and pay'd the Larboard side. Several of the Natives Visited us this morning and brought with them some stinking fish which how ever I order'd to be bought up in order to incourage them in this kind of trafick, but trade at this time seem'd [not] to be their object, but were more inclineable to quarrel and as the Ship was upon the careen I thought they might give us some trouble and perhaps hurt some of our people that were in the boats along side; for this reason I fire'd some small Shott at one of the first offenders&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this made them keep at a proper distance while they stayd which was not long before they all went away. These people declared to us this morning that they never either saw or heard of a Ship like ours being upon this coast before. from this it appears that they have no Tradition among them of Tasman being here, for I beleive Murderers Bay the place where he Anchor'd not to be far from this place but this cannot be it from the Latitude for I find by an observation made this day at Noon that we are at <sub>^</sub><sup>an </sup>anchor in 41&deg;.. 5'..32" S which is 15' to the southward of Murderers Bay
