        Thursday 4<sup>th</sup> In the <small>PM</small> had the Wind at <small>NEBN</small> which obliged us to lay fast. About Six oClock in the Evening one of the Country boats Came a long side in which was the Commander of the Packet before Mentioned &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seem'd to have two Montives for Coming, the one to take an account of the Ship and the other to sell us Refreshments, for in the boat were Turtle, Fowls, Birds &amp;C<sup>a</sup>: all of which they held at a pretty high price and had brought to a bad Market as our <u>Savu</u> Stock was not yet expended. &nbsp;&nbsp;I gave a Spanish Dollor for a small Turtle which wieghd only 36 pounds. With respect to the Ship he wanted to know her Name, the Captains, the place we came last from and where bound, as I would not see him my self, I orderd that no account should be given him from whence we came, but M<sup>r</sup> Hicks who wrote the Ships Name down in his Book, put down from Europe, seeing this he express'd some surprise and said that we might write down what we please'd, for it was of no other use than for the information of such of our Countrymen as might pass these Streights &#151;
