        Sunday 10<sup>th</sup> After hauling round Cape Grafton we found the land trend away <small>NWBW</small>. Three Miles to the Westward of the Cape is a Bay wherein we anchord about 2 Miles from the shore in 4 fathom water an owsey bottom. &nbsp;&nbsp;the East point of the bay bore S<sup>o</sup> 74&deg; East <strike>and</strike> the west point S<sup>o</sup> 83&deg; West and a low <sub>^</sub><sup>green</sup> woody Island laying in the offing bore N 35&deg; East- &nbsp;&nbsp;this Island lies <small>NBE<small>1/2</small>E</small> distant 3 or 4 Legs from Cape Grafton &#151; <sub>^</sub><sup>and is known in the Chart by the name of Green Island</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as the Ship was brought to an Anchor I went <sub>^</sub><sup>ashore</sup> accompaned by M<sup>r</sup> Banks and D<sup>r </sup>Solander, the first thing I did was to look for fresh water and with that View rowed out to wards the Cape because in the bottom of the Bay was low mangrove land and little probability of meeting with any there: but the way I went I found two small streames which w<strike>as</strike>ere difficult to get at on account of the surff and and rocks upon the shore. As we came round the Cape we saw in a Sandy Cove a small stream of water run over the beach; but here I did not go in the boat because I found that it would not be easy to land. We hardly <strike>had time to</strike> advance any thing into the Country, it being here hilly <strike>and the</strike> which were steep and rocky and we had not time to viset the low lands and therefore met with nothing remarkable: My intention was to have stay'd here at least one day to have looked into the Country had we met with fresh water convenient or any other refreshment but as we did not I thought it would be only spending time and looseing so much of a light moon to little purpose and therefore at 12 oClock at night we weigh'd and stood away to the <small>NW</small> having at this time but little wind attended with showers of rain - At 4 oClock the breeze freshend at <small>SBE</small> with fair weather - We continued steering TO <small>NNW<small>1/2</small>W</small> as the land lay haveing 10, 12 and 14 fathom at the distance of 3 Leagues from the land - At 10 oClock we hauld off north in order to get without a small low Island which lay about 2 Leagues from the Main, it being about high water at the time we passd it great part of it lay under water &#151;

        About 3 Leagues to the north westward of this Island <strike>it</strike> close under the Main land is a nother Island tolerable high which bore from us at Noon N. 55&deg; west distant 7 or 8 Miles, we being at this time in the latitude of 16&deg;..20' S<sup>o</sup> Cape Grafton bore S 29&deg; East distant 40 Miles and the northermost <sub>^</sub><sup>point of</sup> land in sight N 20&deg; W<sup>t</sup> and in this situation had 15 fathom water- The shore between Cape Grafton and the above northern point forms a large <strike>bay</strike> but not very deep Bay which I named T<u>rinity Ba</u>y after the day on which it was discoverd <sup>- the north point Cape Tribulation, because here begun all our troubles. Latitude 16&deg;..6' S<sup>o</sup> Long<sup>de</sup> 214&deg;..39' W<sup>t</sup>. </sup>
