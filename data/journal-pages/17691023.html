        Monday 23<sup>rd</sup> <small>PM</small> fresh gales <sub>^</sub><sup>at North</sup> and Clowdy Weather &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 1 Tacked and stood in shore, at 6 sounded and had 56 fath. a fine sandy bottom, the Bay of <u>Tegadoo</u> bore <small>SW<small>1/2</small>W</small> distance 4 Leagues - At 8 Tacked in 36 fathom being then about two Leagues from land. Stood off and on all night having gentle breezes. At 8 <small>AM</small> being right before the Bay of Tegad<sub>^</sub><sup>oo</sup> and about a League from it, some of the Natives came off to us, <strike>these</strike> <sup>and</sup> inform'd us that in a Bay a little to the southward / being the same that we could not fetch the day we put into Tegadoo / was fresh water and easey geting at it - and as the wind was now against us and we got nothing by beating to windward, I thought the time would be better spent in this Bay in geting on board a little water and forming <sub>^</sub><sup>some</sup> connections with the natives <sub>^</sub><sup>than by keeping the sea</sup> With this View we bore up for it and sent two Boats in Man'd and Arm'd to examine the watering place who returnd about noon and conform'd the acco<sup>t</sup> the Natives had given. We then anchord in 11 fathom water a fine sandy bottom - the North point of the Bay <small>NBE</small> and the south point <small>SE</small> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the watering place which was in a small Cove a little within the South p<sup>t</sup> of the bay <small>SBE</small> distant 1 <strike>Le</strike> Mile &#151;
