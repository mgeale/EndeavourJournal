        A fresh steady gale and fine weather. at 1 <small>PM</small> made sail to the westward and at half past 3 saw land to the <small>N.W.</small> which we got up with at sun set, <strike>and</strike> <sub>^</sub> <sup>it</sup> prov'd to be a low woody Island of a circular form and not much above a Mile in Compass &#151; This Island I call'd Thrum Cap, it lies in the Latitude of 18&deg;..35' S<sup>o</sup> and in the Longitude of 139&deg;..48' West from Greenwich, and North 62&deg;. West 7 Leagues from Lagoon Island- We saw no Inhabitants nor the appearence of any and yet we <strike>was</strike> <sub>^</sub> <sup>were</sup> within half a Mile of the Shore. I observed by the shore that it was near Low-water. &nbsp;&nbsp;and at Lagoon Island I observed that it was either High-water or else there was no Ebing and flowing of the sea - from these circumstances I infer that a <small>SBE</small> or South Moon makes High-water-- Here we caught a King Fish being the first fish we have got in those Seas &#151;
