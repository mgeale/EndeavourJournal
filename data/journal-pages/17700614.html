        [note check MS uncorrected] Thursday 14th In the <small>PM</small> had a gentle breeze at <small>SEBE</small> &nbsp;&nbsp;Sent the Master with two boats as well to sound ahead of the Ship as to look out for a harbour where we could repair our defects and put the Ship into a proper trim both of which she now very much wanted - At 3 oClock saw an opening that had the appearance of a harbour &nbsp;Stood off and on while the boats were examining it who found that there was not a sufficient depth of water for the Ship, &nbsp;by this time it was almost sun<strike>t</strike> set and seeing many shoals about us, we anchor'd in 4 fathom water about <strike>3</strike>2 Miles from the shore the Mainland extending from <small>N<small>1/2</small>E</small> to <small>SBE<small>1/2</small>E</small> - At 8 oClock the Pinnace in which was one of the Mates return'd on board and reported that they had found a good harbour about 2 Leagues to leeward &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In consequence of this information we at 6 in the <small>AM</small> weighd and run down to it first sending two boats ahead to lay upon the Shoals that lay in our way and notwithstanding this precaution we w<strike>as</strike>ere once in 3 fathom water with the Ship; having pass'd these shoals the boats <strike>went</strike> were sent to lay in the Cannel leading into the harbour. &nbsp;by this time it begun to blow in so much that the Ship would not work having miss'd stays twice, and being entangled among shoals I was afraid of being drove to leeward before the boats could place themselves, and therefore Anchor'd in 4 fathom about a Mile from the shore and than made the signal for the boats to come on board, after which I went my self and buoy'd the Channel which I found very narrow and the harbour much smaller than I had been told but very convenient for our purpose. At Noon Latitude observed 15&deg; 26' South
