        Wednesday 7<sup>th</sup> In the <small>PM</small> had a light breeze at <small>NBW</small> with which we got out of the Sound and stood over to the eastward in ord[er] to get the Strait well open before the tide of ebb made. At 7 the two small Island which lies off Cape <u>Koamaroo</u> or the <small>SE</small> head of Queen Charlottes Sound bore East distant 4 miles. &nbsp;&nbsp;at this time we had it nearly calm and the tide of Ebb makeing out we were carried by the rapiddity of the stream in a very short time close upon one of the Islands where we narrowly escaped being dashed againest the rocks by bringing the Ship to an Anchor in 75 fathom water with 150 fathoms of Cable out; even this would not have save'd us had not the tide, which first set <small>SBE</small>, by meeting with the Island changed its diretion to <small>SE</small> and carried us past the first point. &nbsp;when the Ship was brought up she was about two Cables lengths of the rocks and in the strength of the stream which set <small>SE</small> at least 4 or 5 Knotts or miles an hour. A little before 12 oClock the tide abated and we began to heave, by 3 the anchor was at the bows and having a light breeze at NW we made sail over for the eastern shore but having the tide againest us we made but little way. The wind afterwards freshend and came to north and <small>NE</small> with which and the tide of ebb we were in a short time hurried thro' the narrowest part of the strait and than stood away for the southermost land we had in sight which bore from us <small>SBW</small>. Over this land appear'd a prodegious high mountain the summit of which was coverd with snow &#151;

        The narrowest part of the strait we have pass'd lies between Cape Koamaroo on <u>Tovy-poenammu</u> and <u>Cape Teerawhi</u>tte on <u>Aeheinomouw</u>e &nbsp;&nbsp;the distance from the one to the other I judged to be between 4 and 5 Leagues and notwithstanding the strength of the tides, now that is known, there is no great danger in passing it. &nbsp;in the doing of which I am of opinion that the <small>NE</small> shore is the safest to keep upon for on that side there appear'd to <sub>^</sub><sup>be</sup> danger whereas on the other shore there are not only the Islands and Rocks lying off Cap<u>e Koamaroo</u> &nbsp;&nbsp;for I discover'd from the hill from which I had the second View of the Strait a Reef of Rocks stretching from these Islands Six or 7 Miles to the Southward and lay about 2 or 3 Miles off from the shore. I shall not pretend <sub>^</sub><sup>here</sup> to assign limets to the length of this strait a view of the Chart will best ellusterate that. About North 9 Leagues from Cape <u>Teerawhitte</u> under the same shore is a high remarkable Island that may be distinctly seen from Queen <u>Charlottes</u> Sound from which it lies <small>NEBE<small>1/2</small>E</small> distant <strike>four</strike> Six or <strike>five</strike> seven Leagues, I have called it Entry Isle and was taken notice of when we first past it on Sunday 14<sup>th</sup> <sub>^</sub><sup>of</sup> last Month. On the East side of Cape Teerawhitte the Land trends away <small>SEBE</small> about eight leagues where it ends in a point and is the southermost land of <u>Aeheinomouwe</u> which I have named <u>Cape Pallisser</u> <sub>^</sub><sup>in honour of my worthy friend Capt Pallisser</sup> / Latitude 41&deg;..34', S<sup>o</sup> Longitude. 183&deg;..58' W<sup>t</sup> / &nbsp;it bore from us <sub>^</sub><sup>this day</sup> at Noon S<sup>o</sup> 79&deg; E<sup>t</sup> distant 12 or 13 Leagues being than in the latitude of 41&deg;..27' S<sup>o</sup> at the same time Cape Koamaroo bore <small>N<small>1/2</small>E</small> distant 7 or 8 Leagues.&nbsp;&nbsp; the southermost point of land in sight bore S<sup>o</sup> 16&deg; W<sup>t</sup> and the Snowey Mountain <small>SW</small> being about three leagues from the shore and a breast of a deep Bay or Inlet, <u>call'd Clowdy bay</u> in the bottom of which appear'd low land cover'd with tall trees &#151;
