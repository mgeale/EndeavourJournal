        Sunday 27<sup>th</sup> We had not stood on <sub>^</sub><sup>to the northward</sup> quite an hour before we fell into 3 fathom water upon which I anchor'd and sent away the Master with two boats to sound the Channell which lay to leeward of us between the Northermost Island and the Mainland which appeard to me to be pretty broad but I susspected that it was shoal<strike>d</strike> and so it was found for the Master reported to me <strike>the</strike> upon his return that he found in many places only 2<small>1/2</small> fathoms and where we lay at Anchor we had only 16 feet which was not 2 feet more then the Ship draw'd. In the evening the wind veer'd to <small>ENE</small> which gave us an oppertunity to stretch 3 or 4 miles back the way we came before the wind shifted to South and oblige'd us again to anchor in 6 fathom &#151;

        At 5 <sub>^</sub><sup>oClock</sup> in the <sup>AM</sup> I sent away the Master with two boats to search for a passage out between the Islands while we got the Ship under sail. As soon as it was light the Signal was made by the boats of thier having found a passage upon which we followd with the Ship, After we had got out and into deep water we hoisted in the boats and made Sail to the Northward as the land lay, soundings from 9 to 15 fathom, having still some small Islands without us

        At Noon we were about 2 Leagues from the Mainland and by observation in the Latitude of 22&deg;..53' S<sup>o</sup> Longitude made from Cape Capricorn &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20 Miles west, At this time the northermost <sub>^</sub><sup>point of</sup> land we had in sight bore <small>N<sup>NW</sup></small> distant 10 Miles &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this point I named C. Manyfold from <sub>^</sub><sup>the number of high hills over it</sup> Latitude 22&deg;..43' S<sup>o</sup> it lies N 26&deg; West distant 17<small>1/3</small> Leagues from C. Capricorn &nbsp;&nbsp;between them the shore forms a large bay which I call'd Keppel Bay and the Islands which lay in and off it are <strike>in</strike> <sup>known by the same name. In this Bay is</sup> <strike>it Lay <sup>are</sup> a great number of Islands and</strike> good anchorage <strike>every where</strike> where there is a sufficient depth of water What refreshments it may afford for shipping I know not we caught no fish here not withstanding we <strike>was</strike> were <strike>the le</strike> at anchor - It can hardly be doubted but what it affords fresh water in <strike>more</strike> <sub>^</sub><sup>several</sup> place as both main land and Islands are inhabited, we saw smooks by day and fires in the night <sup>upon the Main</sup> and people upon one of the Islands &#151;
