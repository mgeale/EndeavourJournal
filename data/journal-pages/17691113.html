        Monday 13<sup>th</sup> <small>PM</small>. Gentle breezes at <small>NW</small>. and clear weather. After taking a slight View of the Country and loading both boats with Sellery, which we found in great plenty near the sea beach, we return'd on board about 5 oClock, the Long-boat at the same time returnd out of the River loaded as deep as she could swim with oysters; and now I intended to put to sea in the morning if wind and weather will permit. In the night had <sub>^</sub><sup>the wind at <small>SE</small> with</sup> rainy dirty hazey weather which continued all day, so that I could not think of sailing, but thought myself very happy in being in <sub>^</sub><sup>a good port</sup>. Sam<sup>l</sup> Jones, Seaman having been confined on Saturday last for refuseing to come upon deck when all ha<sub>^</sub><sup>n</sup>ds were called and afterwards refuse'd to comply with the orders of the officer on deck, he was this morning punished with 12 lashes and remited back to confinement &#151;
