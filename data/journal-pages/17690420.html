        Thursday, 20<sup>th</sup> Wind at <small>S.E.</small> and Squally with rain; all hands employ'd a Shore, and nothing remarkable excepting that a Hog weighing about 90 pounds was brought along side the Ship for sale, but those who brought it would not part with it for any thing we could offer them but a carpenter's broad ax and as this was what we could not part with they carried it away; thus we see those very People who but two years ago prefer'd a spike Nail to an Axe of any sort, have now so far learnt the use of them that they will not part with a Pig of 10 or 12 pounds weight for any thing under a Hatchet, and even those of an inferior <sub>^</sub> <sup>or small</sup> sort are in no great esteem with them - and small Nails such as 10<sup>d</sup> 20<sup>d</sup> or any under 40<sup>d</sup> are of no Value atall; but Beeds particularly white cut Glass Beeds are much Value'd by them &#151;   [<a href="references2.html#10">10</a>]
