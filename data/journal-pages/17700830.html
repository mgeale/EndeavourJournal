        Thursday 30<sup>th</sup> Fresh breezes at <small>SE</small>, <small>ESE</small> and <small>EBS</small>. &nbsp;&nbsp;after steering <small>SWBW</small> 6 Miles we discoverd on our Star [board] bow and a head a strong appearence of shoal water <sub>^</sub><sup>and by this time we had shoalden our water from <strike>5 to</strike> 10 to 5 fathom</sup>, upon which <sub>^</sub><sup>I</sup> made the Pinnace's sign<sup>l</sup> to edge down to it, but she not going far enough we sent the Yawl to sound in it and at the same time hauld off close upon awind with the Ship untill 4 o'Clock at which time we had run Six Miles, but did not depen our water any thing, we then edge'd away <small>SW</small> 4 Miles more, but finding Still Shoal &#151;&#151; water we brought too and call'd the Boats on board by signal <strike>and</strike> hoisted them in and than hauld off close upon a wind, being at this time about 3 or 4 Leagues from the land. The Yawl found only three fathom water in the place where I sent her to sound which place we weather'd about half a mile. Between one and two oClock we pass'd a Bay or Inlet, before which lies a small Island that seems to shelter it from the Southerly winds, but I very much doubt there being water be hind it for Shipping, &nbsp;&nbsp;I could not attempt it because the <small>SE</small> Trade wind blows right in, and we have not as yet had any land breezes <strike>to bring a Ship out &#151;</strike>
        
        <p>
        
        We stretched off to Sea untill 12 oClock at which time we were 10 or 11 Leagues from the land and had depen'd our water to 29 fathom, we now tack'd and stood in untill 5 <strike>o'C</strike> o'Clock, when being in 6<small>1/2</small> fathom water we tack'd and lay her head off untill day light &nbsp;&nbsp;At which time we saw the land bearing <small>NWBW</small> distant about 4 Leagues, &nbsp;&nbsp;we now made sail and Steer'd <small>WSW</small> and then <small>WBS</small>, but coming into 5<small>1/2</small> f<sup>m</sup> we hauld off <small>SW</small> untill we depend our water to 8 f<sup>m</sup> we than kept away <small>WBS</small> and West having 9 f<sup>m</sup> water and the land just in sight from the deck which we judge'd not to [be] above 3 or 4 Leagues off as it is everywhere exceeding low - At Noon we were by observation in the Latitude of 8&deg;..38' S<sup>t</sup> Long<sup>de</sup> 22&deg;2..34' west, &nbsp;&nbsp;St Bartholomeo Isle bore N. 69&deg; East dist<sup>t</sup> 74 M<sup>s</sup> &#151;
