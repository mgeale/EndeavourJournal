        Friday 4<sup>th</sup> First and latter part moderate breeze at <small>ENE</small> &nbsp;&nbsp;in the night calm hot and sultry. In our rout to the northward this after noon we w<strike>as</strike>ere entertain'd at one place with Musick and danceing, the Musick consisted of t<strike>wo</strike>hree drums and the dancing was mostly perform'd by two young women and one man and this seem'd to be their profession, the dress of the women was such as we had not seen before, it was neat decent and well chose and <sub>^</sub><sup>in many respects</sup> not much unlike a European dress<sub>^</sub> <sup>only their arms neck and shoulders were bare and their headdress was the <u>Tomou</u> stuck with flowers</sup>. They made very little use of their feet and legs in dancing, but one part or a nother of their bodies were in continual motion and in various postures, as standing siting and upon their hands and knees, <strike>they would sometimes make wry and very odd faces,</strike> <sub>^ </sub><sup>makeing strange contorsions</sup> their Arms hands and fingers they move'd <sub>^</sub><sup>with great agillity and</sup> in a very extraordinary manner and altho they were very exact in observing the same motions <strike>and gestures</strike> <sup>in all their movements</sup> yet neither their Musick or dancing were att all calculated to please a European &#151;

        There were likewise some men who acted a kind of a Farce but this was so short that we could gather nothing from it only that it shew'd that this People have a notion of Dramatick performances &nbsp;&nbsp;and some of our gentlemen saw them act a Farce the next day wherein was four acts and it seem'd to them to represent a War between the Bolabola men and those of Ulietea wherein the former triumph'd over the latter - but what might help them to draw this conclusion was the knowing that such a thing has not long ago happen'd between these two people and that the Bolabola men <sub>^</sub><sup>at present</sup> posess most of the lands on this Island. This is their grand Dramatick <u>Heiva</u> and I beleive is occasionaly perform'd in all the Islands. Upon my return to the Ship in the evening I found that they had got on board 20 Tons of Ballast and this I thought would be sufficient; in the mor<sub>^</sub><sup>n</sup>ing we sent all our water casks a shore and got them all off full by noon. This morning I received a present from <u>Opoony</u> the <strike>Arrii</strike> Earee dehi of Bolabola who at this time was upon this Island, it consisted of three Hogs, some peices of cloth, Plantains, Cocoa-nuts &amp;C<sup>a</sup> these were sent by his servants and I was told that he would come the next day himself &#151;
