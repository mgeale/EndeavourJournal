        Sence we have been about these Islands we have expended but little of our sea provisions and have <sub>^</sub><sup>at this last place</sup> been very plentifully <sub>^</sub> <sup>supply'd</sup> with Hogs Fouls Plantains and Yams, which will be of very <sub>^</sub><sup>great</sup> use to us in case we should not discover any lands in our rout to the Southward, the way I now intend to Steer &#151;
