        Fresh breeze and Clowdy weather. <small>PM</small> Variation by the mean of 12 Azimuth 5&deg;. 26' East, and by an Amplitude in the morning 7&deg;..52'. At 6 <small>AM</small> saw the Land of Brasil bearing <small>NW</small><small>1/2</small><small>N</small> Dist<sup>ce</sup> 8 or 10 Leagues. At 8 sounded had 37 fathom Coarse sand broken shells and coral rocks. At 9 brought too and spoke with a fishing Boat who informed us that the land in sight lay to the southward of Santo Espiritu. It appears high and mountainous. The drawing N.<sup>o</sup> 3 exhibites a View of this land as it appeared from the Ship /<small>A</small>/ being near to Santo Espiritu, and a remarkable hill /<small>B</small>/ bore <small>NW</small><small>1/2</small><small>N</small> Dist<sup>ce</sup> 7 or 8 Leagues. Made sail in shore the Wind being Southerly, had from the above depth to 14 fathom the same sort of bottom, found the Ship at Noon by observation 10 Miles to the South<sup>wd</sup> of Account, which I suppose to [be] occassioned by a Current seting between the South and West.
