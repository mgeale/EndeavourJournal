        This afternoon I went upon one of the highest hill over the harbour from which I had a perfect View of the inlet <sub>^</sub><sup>or River</sup> and adjacent country which afforded but a very indifferent prospect - the low lands near the <strike>harbour</strike> <sup>River</sup> is all over run with mangroves among which the salt water flowes every tide and the high land appear'd to be barren and stoney &#151; In the <small>AM</small> got the 4 remaining guns out of the hold and Mounted them on the quarter deck - got a spare anchor and anchor stock a shore <sub>^</sub><sup>and</sup> the remaining part of the stores and ballast that were <sub>^</sub><sup>in</sup> the hold - Set up the smiths forge and set the Armourer and his mate to work to make nails &amp;C<sup>a</sup> to repair the Ship &#151;
