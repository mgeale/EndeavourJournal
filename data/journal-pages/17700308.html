        Thursday 8<sup>th</sup> Light airs next to a Calm from <small>SSE</small> to<small> NE</small> with which we kept stearing to the <small>SW</small>, but made but little way because of a swell which took us right ahead. At day light<small> AM</small> we saw, or thought we saw from the mast head the land which we have left to the northward of us join to that to the <small>SW</small> of us, and at the same time we immagined we saw the land extend to the Southward as far as <small>SSW</small>, but after steering this Course untill noon we discover'd our mistake for there was no land to be seen to the Southward of West which course we now steer'd; being by observation in the Latitude of 47&deg;..12' S<sup>o</sup> Longitude made from Cape Saunders West 2&deg; 2' &#151;
