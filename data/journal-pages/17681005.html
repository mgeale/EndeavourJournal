        Light breeze of wind sometimes   clear and sometimes clowdy weather. Variation 6° 10' West by an Azimuth and   Amplitude this evening. At Noon found the ship by the Observ'd Latitude 7 Miles   to the southward of the Logg, and<sub>^ </sub><sup>by</sup>   the observed Longitude 30' to the Eastward of Yesterdays Observation; and as   these Observations for finding the Long<sup>d</sup> /   if carefully observed with good Instruments / will generally come within 10   or 15 M<sup>s</sup> of each other and very often much   nearer, it therefore can be no longer a doubt but that there is a current setting   to the Eastward. Yet we cannot have had this current long because the Longitude   by account and <strike>by</strike> <sub>^</sub>   <sup>that</sup> by Observation agree to-day but yesterday   she was 28' to the westward of the Observation.
