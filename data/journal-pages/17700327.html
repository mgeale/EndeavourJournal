        Tuesday 27<sup>th</sup> Fresh breeze of wind westerly and hazey misty weather with drizling rain. As we have now circumnavigated the whole of this Country it is time for me to think of quiting of it, but before I do this it will be necessary first to compleat our water especialy as we have on board above 30 Tuns of Casks empty and knowing that there is a bay between the above mentioned Island and Queen <u>Charlottes Sound</u> wherein, no doubt there is anchorage and convenient <sub>^</sub><sup>watering</sup> places, <strike>for</strike> accordingly in the <small>PM</small> we hauled round the Island and into the bay, leaving three more Islands on our Starboard hand which lay close under the west shore 3 or 4 Miles within the entrance, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as we run in we kept the lead going and had from 40 to 12 fathom - At 6 oClock we anchord in a 11 fathom water a Muddy bottom under the west shore &nbsp;&nbsp;in the second Cove within the fore mentioned Islands &#151;

        At day light <small>AM</small> I took a boat and went to look for a watering place and a proper birth to moor the Ship in both of which I found convenient enough &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after the Ship was Moor'd I sent an officer a shore to superintend the watering and the Carpenter with his crew to cut wood while the long-boat was employ'd carrying a shore empty casks &#151;
