        Saturday 5<sup>th</sup> This evening we bought as much fish as the whole Ships Compney could destroy while good &nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning I sent the Master to the north end of the Island with the Long-boat to traffick with the Natives for Provisions as they did not bring it to the ship as they had hither to done, and my self, accompaned by M<sup>r</sup> Banks and D<sup>r</sup> Solander went in the Pinnace to the Southern part of the Island partly on the same account and <sub>^</sub><sup>partly</sup> to examine that part of the Island - In our rout we pass'd thro' two harbours equally as good as the <sub>^</sub> <sup>one</sup> in which the ship lays.&nbsp;&nbsp; but the country about them is poorer and but thinly inhabited, and we got no one thing worth bringing home with us, but the Master succeeded something better &#151;
