        Monday 15<sup>th</sup> Winds variable and Clowdy weather. Last Night one of our Water casks <sub>^</sub> <sup>was</sup> taken away from the out side of the Fort where they stood full of water&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the Morning <sub>^</sub> <sup>there was</sup> not one of the Natives but what knew it was gone, yet contrary to what we had always met with on these occasions, not one of them would give us any information about it, and I thought it of too little consequence to take any methods to oblige them &#151;
        
        <p>
        
        Tootaha, would needs lay all night by the Casks to prevent any more from being taken away, but as we had place'd a Centinal there this care of theirs became unnecessary and they were prevaild upon to go home, but before they went away they made signs to the Centinal to keep his eys open &nbsp;&nbsp;from this it should seem that they knew &#151; that an attempt would be made in the night to take away more which would have been done had not the Centinal prevented it &#151;
