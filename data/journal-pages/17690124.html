        Tuesday 24<sup>th</sup> Jan<sup>ry</sup>  The fore and middle part of these 24 hours Moderate gales and clowdy with some  showers of rain, the latter a fresh gale with flying showers: at 7 <small>PM</small>  New Island bore <small>NWBN</small>, and a small Island  laying to the Westward of it bore <small>WBN</small>, Variation  p<sup>r</sup> several Azimuths 21&deg;..0' East which  is much less than we have yet found it upon this coast &nbsp;&nbsp;Yet I am  satisfied with the goodness of the observations &#151;&nbsp;&nbsp; at <small>1/2</small>  past 1 <small>AM</small> the wind shifted from <small>SSW</small>  to <small>ESE</small>. &nbsp;&nbsp;Tacked and stood <small>SW</small>,  at 6 saw the land to the Westward makeing like several Islands &#151;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at  8 two small Islands laying off a low point of land bore <small>WBS</small>  dist<sup>t</sup> 3 Leagues and the small Island we saw  last night bore <small>NNW</small>: this I take to be the  Island of Evouts, it is about one League in circuit and of a moderate height  <sub>^</sub> <sup>and lies 4 Leagues  from the Main</sup> near the south point of it are some peeked Rocks pretty  high above water--&nbsp;&nbsp; the wind coming to the Southward we did but just  Weather this Island, in passing it sounded and had 40 fathom water sand and  broken shells- &nbsp;&nbsp;At Noon it bore <small>NE</small>  Dist<sup>t</sup> one League and the low point of land  before mentioned S<sup>o</sup> 17&deg; West distant 4  or 5 Leagues, Tacked and Stood to the <small>SE</small>  wind at <small>SSW</small> &#151;&nbsp;&nbsp;from this low  point the land trends to the <small>N.W.</small> about 4  Leagues where it ends in a low point round which to the westward appears to  be a deep Bay, unless this land should prove to be an Isl<sup>d</sup>  or Islands which is most likely: it rises into high craggy Hills and the Shore  seems to form several Bays, if so they must afford good shelter for shipping  against southerly and westerly winds &#151;
