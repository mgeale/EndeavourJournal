        Sunday 10<sup>th</sup> Had the winds from the western board all this Day, a gentle breeze and clear weather. In the evening found the Variation to [be] 12&deg;..41' E<sup>t</sup> p<sup>r</sup> Az<sup>th</sup> and 12&deg;..40' by the Amplitude. In the Morning we stood close in with the land <strike>Six</strike> <sub>^</sub><sup>Seven</sup> Leagues to the westward of <u>Doubtless</u> Bay, here the shore forms a nother <sub>^</sub><sup>large open</sup> Bay <strike>lying in south about 3 or 4 Leagues</strike>. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the bottom of this Bay and that of Doubtless bay cannot be far from each other being to all appearence only seperated by a low neck of land from which juts out a peninsula or headland which I have named <u>Knockle</u> point. <small>WBS</small> Six Leagues from this point and about the middle of the bay is a high mountain or hill standing upon a disart shore on which account we call'd it Mount Camel &nbsp;Lat<sup>d</sup> 34&deg;..51' - Long<sup>de</sup> 186&deg;..50'. In <strike>the entrance of this</strike> Bay <strike>it</strike> <sub>^</sub><sup>we had</sup> 24 and 25 fathom Water and the bottom good for anchorage; but there seems to be nothing that can induce shipping to put into it for no Country upon Earth can looke more barren than the land about this Bay doth &nbsp;&nbsp;it is in general low <sup>^</sup><sup>except the mountain just mentioned</sup> and the Soil to all appearence nothing but white sand thrown up in low irregular hills lying in narrow ridges parrallel with the Shore: <sup>this ocasioned M<sup>r</sup> Banks to give it the name it <u>Sandy bay</u></sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;The first ride behind the sea beach is partly cover'd with shrubs Plants &amp;C<sup>a</sup> but the second ridge hath hardly any green thing upon it which induced me to think that it lies open to the western Sea. As barren as this land appears it is not without inhabitants.&nbsp;&nbsp; we saw a Village on the <strike>West point of the Bay</strike> <sup>side of Mount Camel</sup> and a nother on the Eastern side, besides five Canoes that were pulling off to the Ship but did not come up with us - At 9 <small>AM</small> we tack'd and stood to the northward - At Noon Latitude in by Observation 34&deg;..38' S<sup>o</sup> The Cavalle Isles bore <small>SEBE</small> distant 13 Leagues the nothern extremity of the land in sight making like an Island bore <small>NW<small>1/4</small>N</small> Distant 9 Leagues <strike>and the West point of</strike> <sub>^</sub><sup>Mount Camel</sup> &#151;&#151; bore <small>SWBS</small> distant 6 Leagues - Tack'd and stood in shore &#151;
