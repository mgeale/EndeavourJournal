        Tuesday 8<sup>th</sup> After leaving Opoony we proceeded to wards the north point of the Island and <sub>^</sub><sup>in</sup> our way pick'd up half a dozn Hogs as many fouls and some Plantains and Yams, and I had an oppertunity to view and draw a sketch of the harbour which lies on this side of the Island and which was the only thing that induce'd me to make this excursion. After it was dark we met with the long boat which I had in the morning dispatched to a nother part of the Island, and we now made the best of our way to the Ship and got on board about 10 at night. The Carpenter having finished stoping the leakes about the Powder room and sail room, I now intend to sail as soon as ever the wind will permit us to get out of the harbour.
