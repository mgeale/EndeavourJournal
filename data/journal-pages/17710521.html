        Little wind with some heavy showers of rain - At 2  oClock in the <small>PM</small> had some Observations of  the Sun and Moon which gave the Longitude 24&deg;..50' W<sup>t</sup>  2&deg;..28' West of Acco<sup>t</sup> In the Morning it  was Calm and the Ships being near one a nother several of them had their boats  out to tow. We observed the Portland carry out a long warp &nbsp;&nbsp;I being  desirous to <strike>the</strike> <sub>^</sub><sup>see</sup>  [the] Machine they made use of we hoisted out a boat and M<sup>r</sup>  Banks D<sup>r</sup> Solander and my self went on board  her where we was shew'd it, it was <sub>^</sub><sup>made  of Canvas</sup> in every respect like an Umbrello, its circumferance if extended  to a circle was 24 feet tho this was a small one of the sort yet Cap<sup>t</sup>  Elliot told me that it would hold as much as 150 Men could haul. I was so well  satisfied of the utillity of this Machine that I would not have delay'd a moment  in having one made, had not our Forge been render'd useless by the Loss of some  of its parts &#151;
