        Saturday 14<sup>th</sup> Gentle breezes at <small>SE</small> and Hazey weather, In the <small>PM</small> compleated our water <strike>and</strike> got on board all the Bread and part of the Boatswains stores - in the evening sent the turtlers out again. In the <small>AM</small> employd geting on board stone ballast and airing the Spare sails - M<sup>r</sup> Gore being in the Country shott one of the Animals before spoke of it was a small one of the sort weighing only 28 pound clear of the entrails. <strike>its body was &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;length</strike> the head neck and shoulders <sub>^</sub><sup>of this Animal was</sup> very small in proportion to the other parts -<strike> it was hare lip'd but the head <sup>and</sup> ears and teeth were most like a Hares of <sub>^</sub><sup>any animal I know</sup></strike> the tail was nearly as long as the body, thick next the rump and tapering towards the end - the fore legs were 8 <sup>Inch</sup> long and the hind 22. its progression is by hoping or Jumping <sub>^</sub><sup>7 or 8 feet at each hop</sup> upon its hind legs only for in this it makes no use of the fore, which seem to be only design'd for scratching in the ground &amp;C<sup>a</sup>, the Skin is cover'd with a short hairy fur of a dark Mouse or Grey Colour &#151; Excepting the head and ears which I thought was something like a Hare's, it bears no sort of resemblance to any European animal I ever saw, it is said to bear much resemblance to the Gerbua excepting in size the Gerbua being no larger than a common rat &#151;
