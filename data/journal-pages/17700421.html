        Saturday 21<sup>st</sup> Winds Southerly a gentle breeze and clear weather with which we coasted along shore to the northward. In the <sup>PM</sup> we saw the smook of fire in several places a certain sign that the Country is inhabited - At 6 oClock being about 2 or 3 Leagues from the land we shortned sail and sounded and found 44 fathom water a sandy bottom; stood on under an easy sail untill 12 oClock at which time we brought too untill 4 <sup>AM</sup> when we made sail again having than 90 fathom water <sub>^</sub><sup>5 Leagues from the land</sup> At 6 oClock we were a breast of a pretty high mountain laying near the shore which on account of its figure I named Mount Dromedary Lat<sup>de</sup> 36&deg;..18' S<sup>o</sup> Long<sup>de</sup> 209&deg;..55' W<sup>t</sup> / The shore under the foot of this Mountain forms a point which I have named Cape Dromedary over which is a peaked hillick &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time found the Variation <sub>^</sub><sup>to</sup> be 10&deg;.42' E<sup>t</sup> Between 10 and 11 oClock M<sup>r</sup> Green and I took several observations of the Sun and Moon the mean result of which gave 209&deg;..17' West Longitude from the Meridion of Greenwich. By observations made yesterday we were in the Longitude 210&deg;..9' - 20' gives 209&deg;..49' the Longitude of the Ship to day at noon per yesterdays observations, the mean of which and to days gives 209&deg;..33' W<sup>t</sup> by which I fix the Longitude of this Coast - our Latitude at Noon was 35&deg;..49' S<sup>o</sup> Cape Dromedary bore S<sup>o</sup> 30&deg; W<sup>t</sup> dist<sup>t</sup> 12 Leagues - an open Bay wherein lay three or 4 small Islands bore <small>NWBW</small> distant <strike>4</strike> <sub>^</sub><sup>5 or 6</sup> Leagues &nbsp;&nbsp;this Bay seem'd to be but very little shelterd from the sea winds and yet it is the only likely anchoring place I have yet seen upon the Coast
