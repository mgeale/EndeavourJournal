        Monday 6<sup>th</sup> Winds at <small>SE</small> &nbsp;&nbsp;at 2 oClock in the <small>PM</small> it fell pretty moderate and we got under sail and stood out upon a wind <small>NEBE</small> having the Turtle Reef to windward having the Pinnace ahead sounding, we had not stood out long before we discover'd shoals ahead and on both bows, &nbsp;&nbsp;at half past 4 oClock <sub>^</sub><sup>having run off 8 Miles</sup> the Pinnace made the Signal for shoal water in a place where we little expected it, upon this we tack'd and stood on and off while the Pinnace stretched farther to the Eastward, but as night was approaching I thought it safest to anchor which we accordingly did in 20 fathom water a muddy bottom, Endeavour River bore S<sup>t</sup> 52&deg; West &nbsp;&nbsp;Cape Bedford &#151;&#151; <small>WBN<small>1/2</small>N</small> distant 5 Leagues, the northermost land in sight which made like an Island North and a shoal, a small sandy part of which appear'd above water bore <small>NE</small> distant 2 or 3 Miles. In standing off from the Turtle Reef to this place our soundings were from 14 to 20 fathoms, but where the Pinnace was about a Mile farther to the <small>ENE</small> were no more then 4 or 5 feet of water rocky ground and yet this did not appear to us in the Ship. In the morning <sub>^</sub><sup>we had a strong gale from the <small>SE</small> that</sup> instead of weighing as we intended we were obliged to bear away more Cable and to strike topgallant yards
