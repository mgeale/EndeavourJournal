        A Steady breeze and pleasant   weather. At 6 am saw the Island of Bonavista / one of the Cape de Verd Islands   / extending from <small>SBE</small> to <small>SWBS</small>,   Dist<sup>t</sup> 3 or 4 Leagues. Ranged the East side   of this Island at the distance of 3 or 4 Miles from the shore, until we <strike>was</strike>   were obliged to haul off to avoid a Ledge of rocks which stretched out <small>SWBW</small>   from the body or <small>SE</small> Point of the Island 1½   leagues. Had no ground with 40 fathom a mile without this ledge. The Island   of Bonavista is in extent from North to south about 5 Leagues, is of a very   uneven and hilly surface, with low sandy beaches on the East side. The <small>S.E</small>   p.<sup>t</sup> of the Island, from which I take my departure,   by an observation this day at Noon lies in the Lat.<sup>d</sup>   of 16° N and according to our run from Madeira in the Long.<sup>d</sup>   of 21&deg; 51' west from Greenwich and <small>S</small>. 21&deg;  West 260 leagues from Teneriff: drawing No. 1 and 2 represent the appearence   of the East side of this Island where [***] is the <small>SE</small>   point or the hill over it, which is high, of a round figure, and the southermost   on the Island.
