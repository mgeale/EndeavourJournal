        Wednesday 3<sup>rd</sup> Very early this morning Tootaha sent for the Canoe we had detained yesterday, and in the afternoon sent a man for an Ax and a Shirt in return for the Hogs he gave us last night, but as this man told us that Toota ha would not come near us himself in less than 10 days, <strike>th</strike> we thought proper not to send them to try if he would not come himself for them sooner &#151;
