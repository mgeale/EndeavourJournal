        Saturday 13<sup>th</sup> Winds Variable, <small>PM</small> Clowdy weather &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 7 oClock sounded and had 42 fathom water, being distant from the shore between 2 and 3 Leagues, and the peaked mountain as near as I could judge bore East. After it was dark saw a fire upon the shore a sure sign that the Country is inhabited. In the night had some Thunder Lightning, and rain. At 5 <small>AM</small> saw for a few Minutes the Top of the peaked Mountain above the Clowds, bearing <small>NE</small>; It is of a prodigious height and its top is cover'd with everlasting snow. It lies in the Latitude of 39&deg;..16' S<sup>t</sup> and in the Longitude of 185&deg;..15' W<sup>t</sup> I have named it <u>Mount Egmont</u> in honour of the Earl of Egmont &#151;

        This mountain seems to have a pretty large <sub>^</sub><sup>base</sup> and to rise with a gradual assent to the peak and what makes it more conspicuous is, its being situated near the Sea, <strike>and in the middle of</strike> <sub>^</sub><sup>and</sup> a <strike>low</strike> flat Country <sub>^</sub><sup>in its neighbourhood</sup> which afforded a very good asspect &#151; &#151; being cloathed with Wood and Verdure. The shore under the foot of this mountain forms a large Cape which I have named <u>Cape Egmont</u> &nbsp;&nbsp;it lies <small>SSW<small>1/2</small>W</small>, 27 Leag<sup>s</sup> from Albetross point. On the <small>NE</small> side of the Cape lay two small Islands <u><strike>or Rocks</strike></u> near to a very remarkable point on the Main that riseth to a good <sub>^</sub><sup>height</sup> in the very form of a Sug<sup>r</sup> Loafe: To the Southward of the Cape the land tends away <small>SEBE</small> and <small>ESE</small> and seems to be every where a bold shore. At Noon had variable light airs and clear weather. Latitude Observe'd 39&deg;..32' S<sup>t</sup> Cape Egmont bore about <small>NE</small> and we were about 4 Leagues from the Shore in that direction. in this situation had 40 fathoms water
