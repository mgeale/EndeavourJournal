        Sunday 15<sup>th</sup> Moderate breeze  <sub>^</sub><sup>at South &amp; SE</sup>  and Clowdy weather the greater part of this Day &#151;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        
        <p>
        
        At 2<small> PM</small> the Master return'd  with an account that there was Anchorage in 4 fathom water and a good bottom  close to the Eastward of the first black bluf point which is on the East side  of Cape S<sup>t</sup> Vincent, at the very entrance of  the Cove we saw from the Ship / which I named Vincents Bay / before this Anchoring  ground lay several rocky Ledges cover'd with Sea Weed, on these Ledges I was  informed was not less than 8 or 9 fathom, but in standing in with the Ship the  first we came upon had only 4 fathom upon it. I therefore thought that Anchoring  here would be attended with some risk, and that it would be better to endeavour  to find some port in the Strait and there compleat our Wood and Water. however  I sent a Boat with an officer a Shore to attend on M<sup>r</sup>  Banks and People who was very desireous of being aShore at any rate, While I  kept plying as near the shore as possible with the Ship. At 9 they return'd  on board bringing with them several Plants Flowers, &amp;C<sup>a</sup>  most of them unknown in Europe and in that alone consisted their whole Value;  they saw none of the Natives but met with several of their <sub>^</sub>  <sup>old </sup>Hutts-- hoisted the Boat in and made Sail  into the Strats, and at 3 <small>AM</small> Anchor'd in  12<small>1/2</small> fathom Water, / the bottom Corral rock, / before a small cove which  we took for Port Maurice and near <small>1/2</small> a Mile from the shore Cape S<sup>t</sup>  Diego<small> SSW</small> and Cape Bartholomew / which is  the S<sup>o</sup> point of Staten Land / <small>ESE</small>  &#151; Port Maurice appeared to afford so little Shelter for Shipping that I  did not think it worth while to hoist a Boat out to Examine it &#151;&nbsp;We  saw here two of the Natives come down to the Shore who stay'd some time then  retired into the woods again &nbsp;&#151;
