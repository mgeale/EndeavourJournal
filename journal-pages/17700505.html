        Saturday 5<sup>th</sup> In the <sup>PM</sup> I went with a party of Men over to the North shore and while some hands were hauling the Saine a party of us made an excursion of 3 or 4 Miles into the Country or rather along the Sea Coast. we met with nothing remarkable. &nbsp;&nbsp;great part of the Country for some distance in land from the sea Coast is mostly a barren heath diversified with marshes and Morasses - Upon our return to the Boat we found they <sup>had</sup> caught a great number of small fish which the sailors call Leather Jackets on account of their having a very thick skin. &nbsp;&nbsp;they are known in the West Indias. I had sent the yawl in the morning to fish for S<u>ting ray</u>s who return'd in the evening with upwards of 4 hundred weight - one single one weigh'd 240 Ib exclusive of the entrails &#151;

        In the <sup>AM</sup> as the wind still continued northerly I sent the yawl again afishing and I went with a party of Men into the Country but met with nothing extraordinary &#151;
