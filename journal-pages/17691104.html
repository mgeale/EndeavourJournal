        Saturday, 4<sup>th</sup> The first and Middle parts little wind at <small>ENE</small> and clear weather,&nbsp; the Latter had a fresh breeze at NNW and hazey with rain. At 1 <small>PM</small>. three Canoes Came off from the Main to the Ship and after parading about <strike>us</strike> a little while they darted two pikes at us, the first was at one of our <strike>people</strike> <sub>^</sub><sup>men</sup> as he was going to give them a rope thinki<sub>^</sub><sup>n</sup>g that they were coming on board - but the second they throw'd into the Ship, the fireing of one Musquet sent them away. Each of these Canoes were made out <sub>^</sub><sup>of </sup>one large tree and were without any sort of ornament and the people in them were mostly quite naked &#151;
        
        <p>
        
        At 2 <small>PM</small> saw a large opening or inlet in the land which we bore up for with an intent to come to an Anchor. &nbsp;&nbsp;at this time had 41 fathom water which gradually decreased to 9 fathom at which time we <strike>was</strike> were 1<small>1/2</small> Mile from a high tower'd rock lying near the South p<sup>t</sup> of the inlet, the Rock and the northermost of the Court of Aldermen being in one bearing S<sup>o</sup> 61&deg; E<sup>t</sup> At half past 7 Anchor'd in 7 fathom a little within the south entrance of the Bay or inlet. We were Accompaned in here by several Canoes, who stay'd about the Ship untill dark. <strike>but</strike> <sub>^</sub><sup>and</sup> before they went away they were so generous as to tell us that they would come and attack us in the morning, but some of them paid us a Veset in the night, thinking no doubt but what they should find all hands a sleep, but as soon as they found their mistake they went off &#151; My reasons for puting in <sup>here were </sup>the <sup>hopes</sup> <strike>prospect here is</strike> of discovering a good Harbour and the disire I had of being in some convenient place to observe the Transit of Mercury which happens on the 9<sup>th</sup> Instant and will be wholy Visible here if the day is clear. &nbsp;&nbsp;if we should be so fortunate as to Obtain this Observation the Longitude of this place <sub>^</sub><sup>and Country</sup> will thereby be very accuratly determined &#151;
        
        <p>
        
        Between 5 and 6 oClock in the Morning several Canoes came to us from all Parts of the Bay &nbsp;&nbsp;in them were about 130 or 140 People, to all appearences their first design was to attack us being all compleatly Arm'd in their way. &nbsp;&nbsp;however this they never attempted but after Parading about the Ship near three hours, some times trading with us and at other times tricking of us, they disperse'd but not before we had fired a few Musquets and one great gun, not with any design to hurt any of them, but to shew them what sort of Weaphons we had and that we could revenge any insult they offer'd to us. It was observable that they paid but little regard to the Musquets that were fire'd notwithstanding one ball was fired thro' one of their Canoes, but what effect the great gun had I know not for this was not fired untill they were going away &#151;

        At 10 the weather clearing up a little I went with 2 boats to sound the Bay and to look for a more convenient Anchoring place, the Master being in one boat and I in the other, &nbsp;&nbsp;We pull'd first over to the North Shore, where some <strike>some</strike> Canoes came out to meet us, but as we came near them they retired to the Shore and invited us to follow them but seeing that they were all arm'd I did not think fit to except of their inv<strike>a</strike>itation, but after trading with them <sub>^</sub><sup>out of the boat</sup> for a few minutes. &nbsp;&nbsp;we left them and went towards the head of they [the bay]. I observed on a <sub>^</sub><sup>high</sup> po[i]nt a fortified Village but I could only see a part of the woorks, and as I intend to see the whole shall say no more about it at this time. <strike>and</strike> <sub>^</sub><sup>After</sup> having fix'd upon an Anchoring place not far from where the Ship <strike>now</strike> lay<strike>s</strike> I returnd on board &#151;
