        Tuesday 29<sup>th</sup> Fresh gales between the <small>S<sup>SE</sup></small> and <small>E<sup>SE</sup></small>, Hazey we<sup>r</sup>. with some showers of rain in the <sup>PM</sup>. Having sounded about the Ship and found that there was sufficient water for her over the Shoal we at 3 oClock weigh'd and came to sail <sub>^</sub><sup>and stood to the westward as the land lay</sup> having first sent a boat a head to sound - At 6 o'Clock we Anchord in 10 fathom a sandy bottom about 2 Miles from the Main land, the westermost part of which bore <small>W<sup>NW</sup></small> having still a number of Islands <sub>^</sub><sup>in sight</sup> a long way without us &#151;

        At 5 oClock in the <sup>AM</sup> I sent away the Master with two boats to sound the entrance of an inlet which bore from us west distant about one League into which I intended to go with the Ship to wait a few days untill the Moon increased and in the meantime to examine the Country &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by such time as we had got the Ship under Sail the boats made the signal for Anchorge upon which we stood in with the Ship and Anchord in 5 fathom water about a League within the entrance of the inlet which we judged to be a River runing a good way in land. As I observed the tides to flow and Ebb something considerable I had some thoughts of laying the Ship a shore to clean her bottom. &nbsp;&nbsp;with this View both the Master and I went to look for a convinient place for that purpose and at the same time to look for fresh water not one drop of which we could find but met with several places where a Ship might be laid a shore with safety &#151;
