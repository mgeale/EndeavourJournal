        Friday 25<sup>th</sup> In the <sup>PM</sup> had it calm untill 5 oClock when a light breeze sprung up at <sup>SE</sup> and we steer'd <sup>NW</sup> as the land lay untill 10 oClock then brought too having had all along 14 and 15 fathom water. At 5 in the <sup>AM</sup> we made sail, at day light the northermost point of the Main bore N 70&deg; West and soon after we saw more land making like Islands bearing <sup><small>NW</small></sup><small>BN</small>. At 9 oClock we <strike>was</strike> <sup>were</sup> abreast of the point distant from it 1 Mile depth of water 14 fathom. I found this point to lay directly under the Tropick of Capricorn <sup>and for that reason call'd it by that Name</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long<sup>de</sup> 209&deg;..0' West &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is of a moderate height and looks white and barren and may be known by some Islands which layes to the <sup>NW</sup> of it and some small rocks one League <sup>SE</sup> from it. On the west side of the Cape there appear'd to be a Lagoon, on the two spits which form'd the entrance were a great number of Pelicans at least so I call them. The most northermost land we could see bore from C. Capricorn N. 24&deg; West and appear'd to be an Island, but the Main land trended <small>WBN<small>1/2</small>N</small> which Course we steer'd - <sub>^</sub><sup>having from 15 to 6 fathom and from 6 to 9 a hard sandy bottom</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;At noon our Latitude by observation was 23&deg;..24' S<sup>o</sup> C. Capricorn bore S<sup>o</sup> 60&deg;- East distant 2 Leagues a small Island <small>NBE</small> 2 Miles. &nbsp;&nbsp;in this situation had 9 f<sup>m</sup> water at the distance of 4 Miles from the Main land which is here low <sup>and Sandy</sup> next the Sea except the points which are modera<sup>tly</sup> high and rocky &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in land the Country is hilly and affords but a very indifferent prospect
