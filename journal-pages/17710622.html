        Fresh gales with Squalls attend[ed] with Rain. In the Evening had 14 Sail in sight, 13 upon our lee quarter and a Snow upon our lee bow. In the night Split both Topg<sup>t</sup> Sails so much that they were obliged to be unbent to repair- In the Morning the Carpenter reported the Main Top m<sup>t</sup> to be sprung in the Cap which we supposed happen'd in the <small>PM</small> when both the weather backstays broke &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Rigging and Sails are now so bad that some thing or another is giving way every day - At Noon had 13 Sail in Sight which are well assured are the India fleet and are all now upon our weather quarter
