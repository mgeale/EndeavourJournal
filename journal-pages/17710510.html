        At 6 in the <small>AM</small> saw  the Island of Ascention bearing <small>NNW</small> distant  7 Leagues &#151; Made Signal to speak with the Portland and soon after Cap<sup>t</sup>  Elliot himself came on board to whome I dilivered a letter for the Admiralty  and a box containing the Ships common Log books and some of the Officers Journals  &amp;C<sup>a</sup> I did this because it seem'd probable that  the Portland would get home before as we sail much heavier than any of the fleet  &#151; At Noon the Island of Ascention bore <small>EBS</small>  Distant 4 or 5 Leagues - by our Observations it lies in the Latitude of 7&deg;..54'  S<sup>o</sup> and Longitude of 14&deg;..18' West &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A  <small>NWBN</small> Course by Compass or <small>NW</small>  a little westerly by the Globe, from S<small>t</small> Helena  will bring you directly to this Island &#151;
