        Wednesday 2<sup>nd</sup> Moderate  breeze at <small>SE</small> and East with some Showers of  rain. At 3 <small>PM</small> Anchor'd in the entrance of  the channoll leading into the Harbour in 14 fathom water - found a Tide seting  pretty strong out which was the reason that we could not work in: carried out  the kedge Anchor in order to warp into the harbour but after this was done we  could not trip the bower anchor with all the purchass we could make and was  therefore oblig'd to lay still all night &nbsp;&nbsp;but in the morning we did  it with ease and warped the Ship into a proper birth and Moor'd in 28 fathom  a sandy bottom- &nbsp;&nbsp;A great number of the Natives came off to us both  last night and this morning and brought with them Hoggs fouls, Plaintains &amp;C<sup>a</sup>  which they parted with at a very easy rate &#151;
