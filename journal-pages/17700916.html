        Sunday 16<sup>th</sup> Light breezes from the <small>NEBE</small> with Clear weather, except in the Morning when we had it clowdy with a few small showers of Rain. Steerd along shore <small>SW</small> and <small>SWBW</small> untill 6 oClock in the Morning when we Steerd <small>WSW</small> and at 9 oClock west at which time we saw the Island Rotte right ahead At Noon we were in the Latitude of 10&deg;..39' S<sup>t</sup> Long<sup>de</sup> 235&deg;.57' the South end of Timor bore <small>NNW</small> distant 5 or 6 Leagues the Island of Rotte extending from S<sup>t</sup> 75&deg; W<sup>t</sup> to N<sup>o</sup> 67' West and the Island of Anaboa <sub>^</sub><sup>as Dampier calls it, or Seman as it is call'd in the Charts</sup> which lies off the South end of Timor bore <small>NW</small>.

        Dampier who has given us a large and so far as I know an Accurate description of this Island of Timor, says that it is seventy leagues long and sixteen broad and that it lies nearly <small>NE</small> and <small>SW</small>. I found the East side to lie nearest <small>NEBE</small> and <small>SWBW</small> and the South end to lie in the Latitude of 10&deg;.23' S<sup>t</sup> Longitude 236&deg;..5' West from Greenwich &#151;
        
        <p>
        
        We run about 45 Leagues along the East side which I observed to be free from danger, <sub>^</sub><sup>and </sup>excepting near the South end the Land which bounds the Sea is low for 2, 3 or 4 Miles inland and seem'd in many places to be intersected with salt Creeks; behind the low - land are mountains which rise one above another to a considerable height &#151; We continualy saw upon it smooks by Day and fires in the night and in many places houses and plantations - I was strongly importune'd by some of my officers to go to the Dutch settlement <sub>^</sub><sup>at Concordia on this Island</sup> for refreshments, but this I refuse'd to comply with, knowing that the Dutch look upon all Europeans with a jealous eye that come a mong these Islands and our necessities were not so great to oblige me to put into a place where I might expect to be but indifferently treated &#151; <strike>besides I did not see any necessity we had to stop any where untill </strike>
