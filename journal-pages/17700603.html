        Sunday 3<sup>rd</sup> Winds between the <small>SBE</small> and <small>SE</small> A gentle breeze and clear weather - In the <small>PM</small> we steer'd along shore <small>NW<small>1/2</small>W</small> at the distance of two Leagues from the Main having 9 and 10 fathom water regular soundings - At sun set the farthest point of the Main land that we could distinguish as such bore <small>N</small> 48&deg; West, to the northward of this lay some <sub>^</sub><sup>high</sup> land which I took to be an Island the <small>NW</small> point of which bore <small>N</small> 41&deg; West, but as I was not sure that there was a passage this way we at 8 oClock came too an Anchor in 10 fathom a muddy bottom - Two hours after this we had a tide seting to the nortward and at 2 oClock it had <strike>fell</strike> fall<sub>^</sub><sup>e</sup>n <strike>7</strike> 9 feet <strike>and a half</strike> sence the time we anchor'd &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this the tide begun to rise and the flood came from the northward which was from the Islands out at Sea and planly indicated that there was no passage to the <small>NW</small>. But as this did not appear at day light when we got under sail we stood away to the <small>NW</small> untill 8 oClock, at this time we discoverd low land quite aCross what we took for an opening <strike>upon which we hauld to the Eastward</strike> between the Main and the Islands which proved to be a Bay about 5 or 6 Leagues deep - upon this we hauld our wind to the Eastward round the north point of the Bay which bore from us at this time <small>NEBN</small> distant 4 Leagues - From this point we found the Main land trend away <small>NBW<small>1/2</small>W</small> and a strait or passage between it and a large Island or Islands laying in a parrallel direction without; which passage we stood into having the tide of Ebb in our favour - At Noon we were just within the entrance and by observation in the Lat<sup>de</sup> of 20&deg;..26' S<sup>o</sup> Cape Hillsborough &#151; bore <small>SBE</small> distant 10 Leagues and the North point of the bay before mentiond bore S<sup>o</sup> 19&deg; West distant 4 Miles. This point I have named Cap<u>e Con</u>way / Lat<sup>de</sup> 20&deg;..30' <sub>^</sub><sup>Long<sup>de</sup> 211&deg;..28'/ </sup> and the Bay Repulse Bay which <strike>it</strike> is form'd by these <sub>^</sub><sup>Two</sup> Capes <strike>on the north and</strike> &#151;&#151;&#151;&#151;&#151;&#151;&#151;&#151;&#151; <strike>on the South</strike> the greatest and least depth of water we found in it was 13 and 8 fathom every where safe anchorage and I believe that was it properly examined there would be found some good harbours in it especialy on the north side within Cape Conway, for just within this Cape lay two or three small Islands which alone would shelter that side of the Bay from the <small>SE</small> and Southerly winds which seem to be the prevailing or trade winds. Among the many Islands that lay upon this coast there is one more remarkable than the rest being of a small very high and peaked and lies <small>EBS</small>. 10 Miles from Cape Conway at the South end of the Passage above mentioned &#151;
