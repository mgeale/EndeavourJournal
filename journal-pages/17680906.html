        Moderate breezes and clear weather these 24 hours. AM found the Variation by the Mean of 5 Az<sup>th</sup> to be 21° 40' West, <strike>which is</strike> three degrees more than what it was found yesterday, which I cannot account for, <strike>as by this</strike> both Observations appeared to me to be equally well made. At 10° 28' <small>AM </small>had an Observation of the Sun and Moon, which gave the Long:<sup>d</sup> 9° 40' West from Greenwich. By this Observation Cape Finister must lie in 8° 52' and by that made yesterday in 8° 40', the mean of the two is 8° 46' West of Greenwich, the Longitude of the Cape, its Lat:<sup>d</sup> being 42° 53' North.
