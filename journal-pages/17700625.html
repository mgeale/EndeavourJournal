        Monday 25th At low-water in the PM while the Carpenters were busey in repairing the sheathing and plank under the larboard bow I got people to go under the ships bottom to examine all her larboard side &nbsp;&nbsp;she only being dry for<sub>^</sub><sup>w</sup>ard but abaft were 9 feet water, they found part of the sheathing off <strike>under the</strike> abreast of the Main mast about her floor heads and a part of one plank a little damaged. &nbsp;&nbsp;there were three people who went down who all agree'd in the same story, the master was one who was positive that she had received no material damage besides the loss of the sheathing, this alone will be sufficient to let the worm into her bottom which may prove of bad concequence - however, we must run all resk for I know of no method to remedy <sub>^</sub><sup>this</sup> but by heaving <strike>the Ship</strike> <sub>^</sub><sup>her down</sup> which would be a work <sub>^</sub><sup>of </sup>emince labour &amp; time, if not impractical in our present situation &#151;

        The Carpenters continued hard at work under her bottom untill put off by the tide in the eveng and the morning tide did not ebb out far enough to permit them to work for here we have only one tolerable low and high tide in 24 hours &#151;

        In the <small>AM</small> a party of men were emp<sup>d</sup> ashore filling water while others were employ'd in overhauling the rigging &#151;
