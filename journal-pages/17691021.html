        Saturday, 21<sup>st</sup> We had no sooner come to a<sub>^</sub><sup>n</sup> Anchor as mentioned above, than preceiving 2 old men in the Canoes, who from their garbe appear'd to be chiefs. these I invited on board and they came without hesitation. to each I gave about 4 yards of Linnen and a Spike nail &nbsp;&nbsp;the linnen they were very fond of, but the Nails they seem'd to set no Value upon. T<strike>obia</strike>upia explained to them the reasons of our comeing here and that we should neither hurt nor molest them if they did but behave in the same peaceable manner to us, <strike>and it is likely that they will keep their word a</strike> <sub>^</sub><sup>indeed we were under very little apprehension but what they would</sup> as they had heard of what hapned in Poverty Bay &#151;

        Between 1 and 2 <small>PM</small> I put off with the Boats man'd and Arm'd in order to land to look for fresh water, having these 2 Men along with us, but, the surf runing very high and it begun to blow and rain at the same time I return'd back to the Ship having first put the 2 Chiefs into one of their Canoes. In the Evening it fell Moderate and we landed and found 2 small streams of fresh water and the natives to all appearences very friendly and peaceable <strike>and therefore I intend to stay here tomorrow</strike> <sub>^</sub><sup>on which account I resolved to stay one day at least</sup> to fill a little water and to give M<sup>r</sup> Banks an oppertunity to Collect a little of the produce of the Country. In the Morning Lieut<sup>t</sup> Gore went ashore to superintend the watering with a strong party of men, but the geting the Casks off was so very difficult on account of the Sarff, that it was noon before one turn came on board &#151;
