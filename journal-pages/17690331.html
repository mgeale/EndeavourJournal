        A Steady breeze and fine pleasent weather- &nbsp;&nbsp;<small>AM</small> took several Observations of the Sun and Moon, the mean result of them came within 8 Miles of yesterday's Obser<sup>ns</sup> computed both by M<sup>r</sup> Green and my self, and yet I cannot think so great an error can have been commited in the Ships run in so short a time as these observations seem to point out and therefore I shall <strike>stik</strike> <sup>abide</sup> by the Longitude given by the Log, unless from subcequent Observations this error should be found to be just &#151;
