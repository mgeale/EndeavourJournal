        Thursday 12<sup>th</sup> Gentle breezes at <small>NW</small> and north with frequent calms. In the afternoon while we lay becalm'd several <br> canoes came off to the Ship but kept at a distance untill one who appear'd to come from a different part came off and put <br> along side at once and after <strike>him</strike> her all the rest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the people in this boat had heard of the treatment those had met with we had had on board before and therefore came on board without hesitation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they were all kindly treated and very soon enter'd into a traffick with our people for <u>George Island</u> Cloth &amp;C<sup>a</sup> giving in exchange their paddles / having little else to dispose of / and hardly left themselves a Sufficient number to paddle a shore <sub>^</sub> <sup>nay the People in one Canoe after disposing of the Paddles offer'd to sell the Canoe</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;after a stay of about two hours they went away. but by some means or a nother three <strike>was</strike> were left on board and not one boat would put back to take them in and what was more surprising those on board did not seem at all uneasy with their situation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the evening a light breeze springing up at <small>NW</small> we steer'd along shore under an easy sail untill midnight, then brought too &nbsp;&nbsp;soon after it fell calm and continued so untill 8 oClock <small>AM</small> when a breeze sprung up at north with which we stood along shore <small>SSW</small>. At <sub>^</sub><sup>and</sup> after sun rise found the Variation to be 14&deg;..46' East. &nbsp;&nbsp;about this time two Canoes came off to the ship one of which was prevaild upon to come a long side to take in the three people we had had on board all night who now seem'd glad of the oppertunity to get a shore; as the people in the Canoe were a little shy at first it was observed that one arguement those on board made use on to intice the others along side, was in telling them that we did not eat men, from which it should seem that these people have such a Custom among them &#151; At the time we made <strike>we</strike> sail we <strike>was</strike> were a breast of the point of land set yesterday at Noon <sub>^</sub><sup>from</sup> which the land trends <small>SSW</small>. &nbsp;&nbsp;this point I have named <u>cape Table</u> on account of its shape and figure it lies 7 Leagues to the Southward of <u>Poverty Bay</u> in the Latitude of 39&deg;..7' S<sup>t</sup> Long<sup>de</sup> 181&deg;..36' &nbsp;&nbsp;it is of a moderate height makes in a sharp angle and appears to be quite flat at top. In steering along shore to the southward of the Cape at the distance of two or three miles off our soundings <strike>was</strike> <sup>were</sup> from 20 to 30 fath<sup>m</sup> having a chain of rocks that appear'd at different heights above water laying between us &amp; the shore- &nbsp;At Noon <u>Cape Table</u> bore <small>N</small> 20&deg; East distant 4 Leagues and a small Island / being the Southermost land in sight / bore South 70&deg; W<sup>t</sup> distant 3 miles; this Island I have named <u>Isle of Portland</u> on accou<sub>^</sub><sup>n</sup>t of its very great resemblance to Portland in the English Channell &nbsp;&nbsp;it lies a bout a mile from a point on the main but there appears to be a ledge of rocks extending nearly if <sub>^</sub><sup>not</sup> quite a Cross from the one to the other- N 57&deg; E<sup>t</sup> 2 Miles from the South point of Portland lies a sunken rock whereon the Sea breaks. We pass'd between this rock and the land having 17, 18 and 20 fathom water &#151;

        We saw <strike>several</strike> <sup>a great number</sup> of the Natives assembled together on the Isle of Portland, we likewise saw some on the Main land and several places that were cultivated and laid out in square plantations &#151;
