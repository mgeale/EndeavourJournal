        A Gentle breeze and Clear weather.   With a moist air. Soon after sun Rise found the Variation of the Compass to   be 2&deg;.. 24' West being the mean result of sever<sup>l</sup>   very good Azimuths. this was just before we crossed the line in Longitude of   29&deg;.. 29' West from Greenwich. We also try'd the Deping Needle belonging to   the Royal Society and found the North point to dep 26&deg; below the Horizon, but   this instrument cannot be used at sea to <strike>a very</strike>   <sub>^</sub> <sup>any</sup> great degree   of accuracy on account of the motion of the Ship which hindors the Needle from   resting. however as the Ship was pretty steady and by means of a swinging table   I had made for that purpose we could be certain of the dep to two degrees at   most. the observed Lat<sup>.d</sup> and that by account   nearly agrees.
