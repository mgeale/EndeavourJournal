        Friday 18<sup>th</sup> In steering along shore at the distance of two leagues off our soundings was from 24 to 32 fathom a sandy bottom. At 6 oClock <sup>PM</sup> the northern point of land set bore <small>N<small>1/4</small></small> West distant 4 Leagues. At 10 oClock it bore <sup><small>NW</small></sup><small>BW<small>1/2</small>W</small> and as we <strike>could</strike> <sup>had</sup> seen no land to the northward of it we brought too not knowing which way to steer, having at this time but little wind and continued so for the most part of the night - At 2 <sup>AM</sup> we made sail with the wind at <sup>SW</sup> and at day light saw the land extending as far as <small>N<small>3/4</small>E</small> - the point set last night bore <sup><small>SW</small></sup><small>BW</small> distant 3 or 4 Leagues, I have named it <strike>Fiddle Head</strike> ^<sup>Double Island Point</sup> <strike>on account</strike> <sub>^</sub><sup>from its figure</sup> / Lat<sup>de</sup> 25&deg;..58' S<sup>o</sup> Long<sup>de</sup> 206&deg;..48' West / the land <strike>about</strike> <sup>within</sup> this <strike>cape&nbsp;<sub>^</sub></strike><strike>Head</strike> <sup>Point</sup> is of a moderate <strike>Point</strike> and pretty equal height <strike>but that</strike> but the <strike>Cape</strike> <strike>Head</strike> <sub>^</sub><sup>Point</sup> it self is of such an unequal height that it looks like two small Islands laying under the land it likewise may be known <strike>by known</strike> by the white clifts on the north side of it, here the land trends to the <sup>NW</sup> and forms alarge opin bay in the bottom of which the land appear'd to be very low in so much that we could but just see it from the deck - in crosing the mouth of this Bay our depth of water was from 30 to 22 fathom a white sandy bottom &#151;

        At Noon we were about 3 Leagues from the land and in the Latitude of 25&deg;..34' S<sup>o</sup> Long<sup>de</sup> 206&deg;..45 West. Double Isl<sup>d</sup> Point bore S<sup>o</sup><small><small>3/4</small>W</small> and the northermost land in sight <small>N<small>3/4</small>E</small>. The land here abouts which is of a moderate height appears more barren than any we have yet seen on this coast and the soil more sandy there being several large places where nothing else is to be seen &nbsp;&nbsp;in other places the wood looks to be low and shrubby, nor did we see many signs of inhabitants
