        Wednesday 21<sup>st</sup> Emp<sup>d</sup> <strike>t</strike>drying the Powder geting on board Wood, Water &amp;C<sup>a</sup> Confined Rob<sup>t</sup> Anderson seaman for refusing to obey the orders of the Mate when at work in the hold&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This morning a Chief whose Name is Oamno, and one we had not seen before, came to the Fort, there came with him a Boy about 7 years of Age and a young Woman about 18 or 20; at the time of their coming Obarea, and several others were in the Fort <strike>and</strike> they went out to meet them, having first uncover'd their heads and bodies as low as their waists and the same thing was done by all those that were on the out side of the Fort; as we looked upon this as a ceremonial Respect and had not seen it paid to any one before we thought that this Oamo must be some extraordinary person &#151; and wonder'd to see so little notice taken of him after the Ceremony was over&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the young Woman that came along with him <strike>w</strike>Could not be prevaild upon to come into the Fort, and the<strike>y</strike> Boy was carried upon a Mans Back, altho he was as able to walk as the Man who carried him, &nbsp;This lead us to inquire who <strike>is</strike> they were and we was inform'd that the Boy was Heir apparent to the Sovereignty of the Island and the young woman was his sister and as such the respect was paid them, which was due to no one else except the Arreedehi which was not Tootaha from what we could learn. &nbsp;but some other person who we had not seen, or like to do, for they say that he is no friend of ours and therefore will not come near us. The Young Boy above mention'd is Son to Oamo by Obarea, but Oamo and Obariea do not <sub>^</sub> <sup>at this time</sup> live together <strike>now</strike> as man and wife he not being able to endure with her troublesome disposission&nbsp;&nbsp; I mention this because it shews that separation in the Marrige state is not unknown to this people &#151;
