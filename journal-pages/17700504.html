        Friday 4<sup>th</sup> - - - Winds Northerly serene weather &nbsp;&nbsp;Upon my return to the Ship in the evening I found that none of the natives had appear'd near the watering place but about 20 <strike>Canoes</strike> <sup>of them</sup> had been fishing in their Canoes at no great distance from us. In the <sup>AM</sup> as the wind would not permit us to sail I sent out some parties into the Country to try to form <sub>^</sub><sup>some</sup> Connections with the natives. &nbsp;&nbsp;one of the Midshipmen met with a very old man and woman and two <sub>^</sub><sup>small</sup> Children &nbsp;&nbsp;they were close to the water side where several more were in their canoes gat<sub>^</sub><sup>h</sup>ering shell fish and he being alone was afraid to <sub>^</sub><sup>make any</sup> stay with the two old people least he should be discoverd by those in the Canoes - he gave them a bird he had shott which they would not touch neither did they speak one word but seem'd to be much frightn'd, they were quite naked even the woman had nothing to cover her nuditie. D<sup>r</sup> Munkhouse and a nother man being in the woods not far from the watering place discoverd Six more of the natives who at first seem'd to wait his coming but as he was going up<strike>on</strike> to them he had a dart thrown <sup>at</sup> him out of a tree which narrowly escaped him, as soon as the fellow had thrown the dart he desend<sub>^</sub><sup>ed</sup> the tree and made off and with him all the rest and these were all that were met with in the Course of this day
