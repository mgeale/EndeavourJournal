        Wednesday 31<small>st</small> Little wind and variable. In the <small>PM</small> the Carpenter having prepared the two Posts with inscriptions upon them seting forth the Ships name month and year, one of them was set up at the watering place on which was hoisted the Union flag and in the morning I took the other over to the Island which is known by the name of <u>Motu-ouru</u> and is the one that lies nearest to the Sea but before I attempted to set up the post I went first to the Hippa having along with me D<sup>r</sup> Munkhouse and T<strike>ob</strike><sup>upia </sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;we here met with the old man I have before spoke of. The first thing I did was to inquire after the man said to <sub>^</sub><sup>be</sup> killd by our people and the one that was wounded at the same time, when it did not appear to me that any such accidents had happend. I next, by means of <strike>Tob</strike><sup>upia</sup>, explained to the old man and several others that we were come to set up a mark upon the Island in order to shew to any ship that might put into this place that we had been here before.&nbsp;&nbsp; they not only gave their free consent to set it up, but promise'd never to pull it down. I then gave every one present one thing or a nother, to the old men I gave silver, threepenny peices dated 1763 and spike nails with the Kings broad <strike>P</strike> <sub>^</sub><sup>Allow</sup> cut deep in them things that I thought <strike>was</strike> were most likely to remain long among them &#151;

        After I had thus prepare'd the way for seting up the post we took it up to the highest part of the Island and after fixing it fast in the ground hoisted thereon the Union flag and I dignified this Inlet with the name of Queen <u>Charlottes Sound</u> and <sub>^</sub><sup>took</sup> formal posession of it and the adjacent lands in the name and for the use of his Majesty. &nbsp;&nbsp;we then drank Her Majestys hilth in a Bottle of wine and gave the empty bottle to the old man / who had attended us up the hill / with which he was highly pleased. Whilest the post was seting up we asked the old man about the <u>Strait</u> or passage into the Eastern Sea and he very plainly told us there was a passage and as I had some conjectors that the lands to the <small>SW</small> of this strait / which we are now at / was an Island and not part of a continent we questioned the old man about it who said it consisted of two Wannuaes, that is two lands or Islands that might be circumnavigated in a few days, even in four &#151; This man spoke of three lands, the two above mentioned <sub>^</sub><sup>which he call'd <u>Tovy-poenammu</u> which signifies green Talk or stone such as the[y] make their tools on, oramints &amp;C<sup>a</sup></sup> and for the third he pointed to the land on the East side of the <u>Strait</u> this he said was a large land and that it would take up a great many moons to sail round it. or some thing to the same purpose <sub>^</sub> <sup>this he calld <u>Aeheino mouwe</u> a name m[an]y others before had call'd it by, that part which borders on the strait he calld Teira whitte - </sup> After we had done our business upon the Island we return'd on board bringing the old man a long with us who after dinner went a shore in a canoe that came to attend upon him &#151;
