        Sunday 31<sup>st</sup> Clear pleasent  weather all this day. In the morning we got on boa<sub>^</sub><sup>r</sup>d  a whole Ox which we cut up and salted- I had eat ashore some of as good and  fat beef as ever I eat in my life and was told that I might have as good to  salt, but in this I was very much disapointed, the one I got was thin and lean,  yet well taisted &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it weighed 408 lb<sup>s</sup>
