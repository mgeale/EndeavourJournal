        Friday 22nd. Winds at SE fair weather. At 4 In the PM having got out most of the Coals, cast loose the moorings and warped the Ship a little higher up the harbour to a place I had pitched upon to lay a Shore for stoping the leak, her draught of Water forward 7 feet 9 Inches and abaft 13 feet 6 Inches &nbsp;&nbsp;At 8 being high water hauld her bow close a shore but kept her stern a float because I was afraid of neeping her and yet it was necessary to lay the whole of her as near the ground as possible - At <sub>^</sub><sup>2</sup> oClock in the <small>AM</small> the tide left her which gave us an oppertunity to examine the leak which we found to be at her floor heads a little before the Starboard fore chains - here the rocks had made their way thro' four Planks, quite to <sub>^</sub><sup>and even into the</sup> timbers and wound'd three more. &nbsp;&nbsp;the manner these planks were <sub>^</sub><sup>damaged or</sup> cut out as I may say is hardly credable - scarce a splinter was to be seen, but the whole was cut away as if it had been done by the hands of Man with a blunt edge tool - fortunately for us the timbers in this place were very close other wise it would have been impossible to have saved the ship and even as it was it appear'd very extraordinary that she <strike>did not</strike> made no more water than what she did - A large piece of Coral rock was sticking in one hole and several pieces of the fothering, small stones, sand &amp;C<sup>a</sup> had made its way in and lodged between the timbers which had stoped the water from forceing its way in in great quantities &#151;

        Part of the sheathing was gone from under the larboard bow &nbsp;part of the false keel was gone and the remainder in such a shatter'd condition that we should be much better <sup>of</sup>, was <strike>was</strike> it gone also - her fore foot and some part of her Main keel was also damaged but not materialy &nbsp;&nbsp;what damage she may have received abaft we could not see but beleive not much as the Ship makes <strike>no</strike> <sub>^</sub><sup>but little</sup> water while the Tide keeps below the leak forward - At 9 oClock the Carpenters went to work upon <sub>^</sub><sup>the Ship</sup> while the Smiths were busy makeing bolts nails &amp;C<sup>a</sup> &#151;
