        Wednesday 24<sup>th</sup> <small>PM</small> had a fresh breeze Southerly and Clowdy weather. After dinner I employ'd my self in carrying on the Survey of the place and upon one of the Islands where I landed <strike>was</strike> were a number of houses but no inhabitants neither had any been there lately. In the morning the Gunner was sent a shore with the <sub>^</sub><sup>remainder of the</sup> powder to dry, and the Long-boat was sent with a gang of hands to one of the Islands to cut grass for our sheep <sup>and</sup> the rest of the people were employ'd about the usual work of the Ship. This fore-noon some of us viseted the Hippa, which is situated on the point of the Island. mentioned on our first arrival. the In habitants of this place shew'd not the least dislike at our coming but on the contrary with a great deal of seeming good nature shew'd us all over the place &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we found a mong them some human bones the flesh of which they told us they had eat, they likewise inform'd us that there was no passage into the Sea thro' this inlet as I had immagined their might because above where I was in the Boat it turn'd away to the west ward. Leaving these people we travel'd to the other end of the Island and there took water and cross'd over upon the Main where we met with several ho<sup>u</sup>ses that were at present or had very lately been inhabited but we saw but very few of the Inhabitents and these were in there boats fishing. After viewing this place we returnd on board to dinner &#151;
