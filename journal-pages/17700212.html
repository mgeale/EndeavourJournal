        Monday 12<sup>th</sup> Most part of <small>PM</small> had a fresh breeze at <small>N, E,</small> which by sun set carried us the length of <u>C. Palliss</u>er and as the weather was clear I had an oppertunity of Viewing the land of this Cape which is of a height sufficient to be seen in clear weather 12 or 14 Leagues off and is of a broken and hilly surface; between the foot of the high land and the Sea is a border of low flat land off which lies some rocks <sub>^</sub><sup>that appear</sup> above water. Between this Cape and Cape Turnagain <strike>which is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leagues N &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strike>&nbsp;the land near the shore is in many places low and flat and appear'd green and pleasent, but inland are many hills. From Cape Pallisser to Cape Teera-whitte <strike>the Course is <small>NW<small>1/2</small></small> and NW distant &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leagues, the land between them the land</strike> <sup>the land</sup> is tollerable high makeing in Table points and the Shore forms two Bays, at least it appear'd so for we were always too far off this part of the Coast to be particular &#151;

        The wind continued at <small>NE</small> untill 12 at night when it died away and veer'd round to the West and afterwards to South and <small>SSE</small> little wind so that by noon we had advanced no farther than 41&deg;..52' South Latitude Cape Pallisser bearing North distant 5 Leagues and the snowey mountain bore S<sup>o</sup> 83&deg; West &#151;
