        Sunday 22d In the <sup>PM</sup> had a gentle breeze at <small>SBW</small> with which we steerd along shore <small>NBE</small> and <small>NNE</small> at the distance of about 3 Leagues; saw the smook of fire in several places near the Sea beach. At 5 oClock we were abreast of a Point of land which on account of its perpendicular clifts I call'd Point Upright <sub>^</sub><sup>/ Lat<sup>de</sup> 35&deg;..35'/</sup> it bore from us due west distant 2 Leagues and in this situation had 31 f<sup>m</sup> water a Sandy bottom - At 6 oClock falling little wind we hauld off <small>ENE</small> &nbsp;&nbsp;at this time the Northermost land in sight bore <small>NNE<small>1/2</small>E</small> - At midnight being in 70 fathom water we broug<sup>t</sup> too untill 4 <sup>AM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</sup>at which time we made sail in for the land and at day light found our selves nearly in the same place we <strike>we</strike> <strike>was</strike> <sup>were</sup> at 5 oClock in the evening by which it was apparent that we had been drove <strike>between</strike> about 3 Leagues to the Southward by a Tide or Current in the night, after this we steerd along shore <small>NNE</small> having a gentle breeze at <small>SW</small>. and were so near the Shore as to distinguish several people upon the Sea beach &nbsp;&nbsp;they appear'd to be of a very dark or black Colour but whether this was the real colour of their skins or the C[l]othes they might have on I know not - At Noon we were by observation in the Latitude of 35&deg;..27' and Long<sup>de</sup> 209&deg;..23'. Cape Dromedary bore S<sup>o</sup> 28&deg; West dist<sup>t</sup> 19 Leag<sup>s</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a remarkable peaked hill <sub>^</sub><sup>laying inland</sup> the top of which look'd like a Pigeon house and occasioned my giving it that name, bore N 32&deg;..30' W<sup>t</sup> and a small low Island laying close under the shore bore <sup>NW</sup> dist<sup>t</sup> 2 or 3 Leagues, Variation of the Compass 9&deg;..50' E<sup>t</sup> When we first discover'd this Island in the morning I was in hopes from its appearence that we should have found shelter for the Ship behind it but when we came to approach it near I did not think that there was even security for a boat to land, but this I believe I should have attempted had not the wind come on shore &nbsp;after which I did not think it safe to send a boat from the ship as we had a large hollow sea <sub>^</sub><sup>from ye <small>SE</small></sup><small> </small>rowling in <strike>from the <small>SE</small></strike> upon the land which beat every were very high upon the Shore and this we have had ever sence we came upon the Coast. The land near the Sea coast still continues of a moderate hieght forming alternatly rocky points and Sandy beaches, but inland between Mount Dromedary and the Pigeon house are several pretty high Mountains two only of which we saw but what were coverd with trees and these lay <sub>^</sub><sup>inland behind</sup> <strike>near to</strike> the Pigeon house and <sub>^</sub><sup>are</sup> remarkably flat atop with steep rocky clifts all round them as far as we could see - the trees in this Country hath all the appearence of being stout and lofty - For these two days past the observe'd Latitude hath been <sub>^</sub><sup>12 or 14 Miles</sup> to the Southward of the Ships account given by the Log which can be owing to nothing but a Curre[n]t set to the Southward &#151;
