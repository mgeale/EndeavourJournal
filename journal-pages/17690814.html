        Fresh breezes and fair weather. At 2 <small>P.M.</small> Saw land bearing <small>SE</small> which <strike>Tobia</strike> <sup>Tupia</sup> calls the Island of Ohetiroa: At 6 was within two or 3 Leagues of it, the extreams bearing from <small>SBE</small> to <small>SE</small>. Shortend sail and stood off and on all night &nbsp;&nbsp;At 6 <small>AM</small> made sail and stood in for the land and run to leeward of the Island keeping close in shore all the time - saw several of the Natives as we run a long shore but in no great numbers. At 9 hoisted out the Pinnace and sent Lieut<sup>t</sup> Gore M<sup>r</sup> Banks and T<strike>obia</strike><sup>upia</sup> to endeavour to land upon the Island, and to speake with the natives, and to try if they could learn from them what lands lay to the southward of us.&nbsp; and likewise to see if there was Anchorage in a Bay which appear'd to our veiw, not that I intended to anchor or make any stay here - -
