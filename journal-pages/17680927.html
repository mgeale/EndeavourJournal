        The same wind and weather this   day as yesterday. Served Wine to the Ships Compney, the Beer being all expended   to two cask which I intend to keep some time longer, as the whole has proved  very good to the Very last Cask. At Noon found the ship by Observation 10 miles   a head of the Log, which I suppose may be owing to a current Setting in the  same diriction <strike>of</strike> as the trade wind.
