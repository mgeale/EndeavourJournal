        Monday 10<sup>th</sup> The 2 Marines not returning this morning I began to enquire after them &amp; and was inform'd by some of the Natives that they were gone to the Mountains &amp; that they had got each of them a Wife and &amp; would not return, but at the same time no one would give us any Certain intelligence where they were; upon which a resolution was taken to seize upon as many of the Chiefs <strike>and</strike> as we could.&nbsp;&nbsp; this was thought to be the readiest method to induce the other natives to produce <strike>that</strike> the two men. We had in <strike>our</strike> our Custody Obarea, <strike>Tabia</strike> Tooboura tomita, and two other Chiefs but that I know'd that Tootaha would have more weight with the Natives than all these put together, I dispatch'd Lieut<sup>t</sup> Hicks away in the Pinnace to the place where Tootaha was to endeavour to decoy him into the boat and bring him on board which M<sup>r</sup> Hicks perform'd without the least disturbance. We had no sooner taken the other Chiefs into Custody in M<sup>r</sup> Banks's Tent, than they became as desireous of having the men brought back has they were before of keeping them, and only desire'd that one of our people might be sent with some of theirs for them; accordingly I sent a Petty Officer and the Corporal of Marines with three or four of their people not doubting but they would return with the two Men in the evening, but, <sub>^</sub> <sup>they</sup> not coming as soon as I expected I took all the Chiefs on board the Ship for greater safety. About 9 <strike>o</strike> oClock in the evening Web the Marine was brought in by some of the Natives and sent on board, he inform'd me that the Petty officer &amp; the Corporal that had been sent in quest of them were disarm'd and seiz'd upon by the Natives and that Gibson was with them. Immidiatly upon geting this information I dispatch'd M<sup>r</sup> Hicks away in the Long boat with a Strong party of men to resque them but before he went - - - - - Tootaha and the other Chiefs <sub>^</sub> <sup>was made to understand</sup> that they must send some `of their people with M<sup>r</sup> Hicks to shew him the place where our men were, and at the same time to send orders for their immidiate releasement for if any harm came to these men, they, the Chiefs, would suffer for it.&nbsp;&nbsp; and I believe at this time they wished as much to see the Men return in Safty as I did, for the guides conducted M<sup>r</sup> Hicks to the place before day light and he recover'd the men without the least opposission: and return'd with them about 7 oClock in the morning of [Tuesday 11<sup>th</sup> ]
