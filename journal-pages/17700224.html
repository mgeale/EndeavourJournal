At day light the wind began to freshen and before noon blowed a fresh gale and veer'd to <small>NNE</small>. At 8 <small>AM</small> saw the land extending as far as <small>SWBS</small> which we steer'd directly for and at Noon <strike>was</strike> <sub>^</sub><sup>we were</sup> in the Latitude of 45&deg;..22' S<sup>o</sup> the land in sight extending from <small>SW<small>1/2</small>S</small> to <small>NNW</small>, makeing high and hilly.
