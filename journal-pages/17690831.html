        The first a fresh breeze and Clowdy. At 6 <small>P</small>.<small>M</small>. ha<sub>^</sub><sup>u</sup>led the wind to the <small>SW</small> and close reef'd the Topsails. At 1 <small>AM</small> being very Squally with rain, took in the Topsails and bro<sup>t</sup> too under the Main sail, At 6 made sail under the Courses- Saw some <sub>^</sub><sup>sea</sup> weed &nbsp;&nbsp;sounded but had no ground with 65 f<sup>m</sup> of line. Some Albetrosses Sheer waters and a great many Pintado Birds about the Ship, with some hundreds of Birds that were smaller than Pigeons, their backs were grey, their bellies white and the ends of their tails black, and have a blackesh line along the upper parts of the wings from the tip of one to the other. We saw birds very like those near Faulklands Islands on the Coast of Patagonia, only they had not the black strake a long the wings. they fly low like sheer waters or Mother Caries Birds and are perhaps of the same tribe. For distinction sake I shall call them Doves -
