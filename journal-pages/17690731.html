Plying to windward all this day on the <small>SW</small> side of Otaha without gaining little or any thing, &nbsp;in the middle watch was oblig'd to double reef our Topsails but in the morn.g it fell moderate and <sub>^</sub><sup>we</sup> crow<sub>^</sub><sup>d</sup>ed all the sail we could - At Noon the South end of Otaha bore East distant 2 Leagues. Lat<sup>d</sup> Obser<sup>d</sup> 16&deg;.40' South &nbsp;&nbsp;T<strike>obia</strike><sup>upia</sup> told us there was a very good harb<sup>r</sup> within the reef which lies on this side of Otaha but this Harbour I shall discribe in a nother place &#151;
