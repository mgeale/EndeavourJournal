        Wednesday 18<sup>th</sup> Winds at <small>ESE</small> a gentle breeze &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the <small>PM</small> I sent the Master and one of the mates in the Pinnace to the northward to look for a Channell that way clear of the shoals. M<sup>r</sup> Banks, D<sup>r </sup>Solander and my self took a turn into the woods on the other side of the water where we met with five of the natives and altho we had not seen any of them before they came to us without showing the least signs of fear, two of these wore necklaces made of shells which they seem'd to Value as they would not part with them - In the evening the Yawl came in with three turtle and early in the <small>AM</small> she went out again - about 8 oClock we <strike>was</strike> <sup>were</sup> viseted by several of the natives who now became more familiar than ever, soon after this M<sup>r</sup> Banks and I went over to the south side of the <strike>harbour</strike> <sup>River</sup> and travel'd six or 8 miles along shore to the northward where we assended a high hill from whence <strike>I</strike> <sup>we</sup> had an extensive view of the Sea Coast <sub>^</sub><sup>to leeward</sup> <strike>which was cover'd with shoals as far as the eye could see</strike> <sup>afforded us a Meloncholy prospect of the difficultys we are incounter, for in what ever direction we turn'd our eys Shoals inumberable were to be seen</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after this we return'd to the Ship without meeting with any thing remarkable and found several of the natives on board, at this time we had 12 <strike>Tortoise</strike> <sub>^</sub><strike>Turtle</strike> <sup>Turtle</sup> upon our decks which they took more notice of then any thing else in the ship as I was told by the officers for their curiosity was satisfied before I got on board and they went away soon after
