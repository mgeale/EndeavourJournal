        Friday, 20<sup>th</sup> <small>P.M.</small> a fresh breeze at <small>SSW</small>, in the night Variable light breezes with rain &nbsp;&nbsp;<small>AM</small>, a fresh breeze at <small>SW</small>. At 3 <small>PM</small> pass'd by a remarkable head Land which I call'd <u>Gable-end Foreland</u> on account of the very great reseblence the white clift at the very point hath to the Gable end of a house &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is made still more remarkable by a spire'd rock standing a little distance from <strike>the point</strike> it. <strike>t</strike> This head land <strike>land</strike> lies <sub>^</sub><sup>from</sup> Cape Table <strike>Ea</strike> N 24&deg; East distant 12 Leagues &nbsp;&nbsp;between them the Shore forms a Bay wherein lies Poverty Bay, 4 Leagues from the former and 8 Leagues from the Latter. From Gable end Forland &#151; the land trends <small>NBE</small> as far as we could see: the land <strike>betwe</strike> from Poverty Bay to this place is of a moderate but very unequal height distinguished by hills and Vallies that are cover'd with woods: we saw as we run along shore several Villages cultivated lands and some of the Natives, in the evening some Canoes came off to the Ship and one man came on board to whom we gave a few trif<strike>f</strike>les and then sent him away. Stood off and on untill day light then made sail in shore in order to look into two Bays that appear'd to our View about 2 Leagues to the northward of the Foreland &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the southermost we could not fetch, but in the other we anchor'd about 11 oClock in 7 fathom water a black sandy bottom; the North point bore <small>NE<small>1/2</small>N</small> distant 2 Miles and the S<sup>o</sup> point <small>SEBE</small> dist<sup>t</sup> 1 Mile and about <small>3/4</small> of a Mile from the Shore. This Bay is not so much shilterd from the sea as I at first thought it was. but as the Natives ma<sub>^</sub><sup>n</sup>y of whom <strike>have</strike> came about us in their canoes, appear'd to be of a friendly disposission I <strike>am</strike> was willing to try if we <strike>can</strike> could not get a little water on board, and to see a little into the nature of the Country before we proceed<sup>'d</sup> farther to the northward &#151;
