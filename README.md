### Captain James Cook onboard HMS Endeavour, 1768 to 1771

On his voyage to the South Pacific, Captain James Cook kept a journal where documented his experiences.

In it he tracks the ship's course as it travels from Plymouth, England, underneath Cape Horn, across the Pacific to Tahiti, around New Zealand, and up the east coast of Australia.

Along the way he writes of his encounters with Tahiti Polynesians, New Zealand Maori and Australian Aborigines.

In this web app I have tried to present his journal entries in a format that is easy to follow using Google Maps. The dataset was downloaded from the Australian National Library website, <a href="http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/3525402" target="_blank">see more</a>.
