        Wednesday 14<sup>th</sup> <small>PM</small> a <u>fresh</u> breeze sprung up at <small>NE</small> and we steer'd <small>SWBW</small> for the Southermost land we had in sight which bore from us at sun set S<sup>o</sup> 74&deg; West &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time we found the Variation to be 15&deg;..4' East. At 8 <small>AM</small> it fell Calm, at <strike>d</strike> <strike>a</strike> <sub>^</sub><sup>this</sup> time we had run 21 Leagues S<sup>o</sup>.58&deg; W<sup>t</sup> sence yesterday at noon which brought us abreast of the high <sub>^</sub><sup>Snowey</sup> Mountain <strike>seen the day we pass'd the Strait</strike> it bearing from us <small>NW</small>, in this direction it lay behind a mountainous ridge of nearly the same height which riseth derectly from the Sea and runs parallel with the shore which lies <small>NE<small>1/2</small>N</small> and <small>SW<small>1/2</small>S</small>. The <small>NE</small> end of the ridge <strike>lies</strike> <sub>^</sub><sup>takes its rise</sup> but a little way inland from <u>Cape Campbe</u>l. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These mountains are distinctly seen <strike>from</strike> both from Cape Koamaroo and Cape Pallisser &#151;&#151; being distant from the former <small>SW<small>1/2</small>S</small> 22 Leagues and from the latter <small>WSW</small> 30 &#151; Leagues, but they are of a height sufficient to be seen at a much greater distance; by some on board they are thought to be much higher than the Pico of Teneriff which I cannot agree to, neither do I think them so high as <u>Mount Egmon</u>t on the <small>SW</small> Coast of <u>Aehei-no-mouwe</u> founding my opinion on the sumit of the latter being almost wholy cover'd with Snow, where as it only lies upon these in patches &#151;

        At noon was <sub>^</sub><sup>we were</sup> in the Latitude of 42&deg;..34' S<sup>o</sup> the Southermost land we had in sight bore <small>SW<small>1/2</small>W</small>, and some low land that made like an Island lying close under the foot of the Ridge, bore <small>NWBN</small>, distant about 5 or 6 Leagues &#151;
