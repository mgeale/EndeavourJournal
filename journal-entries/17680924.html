        A Fresh breeze and clear weather   the most part of these 24 hours. I take this to be the <small>NE</small>   Trade we have now got into. At 6 pm the <small>NE</small>   end of the Island of Teneriff <small>WBN</small> Dist<sup>t</sup>   3 or 4 Leagues. Off this <small>NE</small> point ly some   rocks high above water the highest is near the point and very remarkable. By   our run from yesterday at Noon this end of the Island must lay in the Lat<sup>d</sup>   of 28&deg; 27' and S. 7&deg; 45' <small>E</small> Dist<sup>t</sup>   83 leagues from Fenchall, and S 18&deg;<small> W</small> 98   Miles from the Salvages. At 1 am the Peek of Teneriff bore <small>WNW</small>.   Found the Variation to be this morng 16&deg; 14' West. The Peak of Teneriff / from   which I now take my departure / is a very high mountain upon the Island of the   same name, one of the Canarie Islands, its perpendicular higth from Actual Measurement   is said to be 15396 feet. It lies in the Lat<sup>d</sup>   of 28&deg; 13' N and Longitude 16&deg; 32' from Greenwich, its situation in this respect   is allowed to be pretty well determined.
