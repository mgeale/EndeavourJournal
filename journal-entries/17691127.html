        Monday 27<sup>th</sup> <small>PM</small> Gentle breezes Easterly and clear weather. At 3 pass'd the point of land before Mentioned, which I have named Cape <u>Brett</u> in honour of S<sup>r</sup> Percy. The land of this Cape is considerable higher than any part of the adjacent Coast: at the very point of the Cape is a high round hillock and <small>NEBN</small> near one Mile from this is a small high Island or Rock with a hole perced quite thro' it like the Arch of a Bridge and this was one reason why I gave the Cape the above name because Piercy seem'd very proper for that of the Island. This Cape or at least some part of it, is call'd by the Natives <u>Motugogogo</u> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lat<sup>d</sup> 35&deg;..10'.. 30" S. Longitude. 185&deg;..25' West. On the west side of Cape <u>Brett</u> is a large and pretty Deep Bay lying <sub>^</sub><sup>in</sup> <small>SWBW</small> in which there appear'd to be several small Islands - The point that forms the <small>NW</small> entrence <sub>^</sub><sup>I have named <u>Point Pococke</u> it</sup> lies <small>W<small>1/4</small>N</small> <sub>^</sub><sup>3 or</sup> 4 Leag<sup>s</sup> from Cape Brett. On the <small>SW</small> side of this Bay we saw several Villages situated both on Islands and on the Main land from whence came off to us several large Canoes full <sub>^</sub><sup>of</sup> people, but like those that had been along side before would not enter into a friendly traffick. with <sub>^</sub><sup>us</sup>, but would cheat when ever they had an oppertunity. The people in these Canoes made a very good appearence, being all stout well made men, having their hair which was black Comb'd up and tied upon the Crown of their heads and there stuck with white feathers, in each of the Canoes <strike>was</strike> <sup>were</sup> two or three Cheifs and the habits of these <strike>was</strike> <sup>were</sup> rather superior to any we <strike>have</strike> had yet seen.&nbsp;&nbsp; the Cloth they were made on was of the best sort and cover'd on the out side with Dog skins put on in such a manner as to look agreeable enough to the Eye. Few of these people were tattow'd or mark'd in the face, like those we have seen farther to the south, but several had their Backsides tattou'd much in the same manner as the Inhabitants of the Islands within the Tropics &#151;

        In the Course of this Day, that is this afternoon and yester forenoon, we reckoned that we had not less than four or five hundred of the Natives alongside and on board the ship, and in that time did not rainge above 6 or 8 Leagues of the Sea-Coast: a strong proff that this part of the Country must be well inhabited &#151;

        In the Evening the wind came to the westward of north and we tacked and stood off <small>NE</small> until a 11 oClock when the wind coming more favourable we stood again to the westward. At 8<small> AM</small> we were within a Mile of Group of small Islands lying close under the Main land and <small>NWBW<small>1/2</small>W</small> distant 22 Miles from Cape Bret.&nbsp;&nbsp; here we lay for near two hours having little or no wind: dureing this time several Canoes came off to the Ship and 2 or 3 of them sold us some fish &#151; <sup>Cavalles as they are called which occasioned my giving the Islands the same name </sup>after this, some others began to pelt us with stones and would not desist at the fireing of two Musquet Balls thro' one of their boats: at last I was obliged to pepper two or of the three fellows with small shott after which they retired, and the wind coming at <small>NW</small> we stood off to sea. At Noon the <strike>above</strike> <sup>Cavalle</sup> Islands bore <small>SWBS</small> distant 4 Miles, Cape Bret <small>SE</small> distant 7 Leag<sup>s</sup> and the Westermost land in Sight making like Islands bore west and by north.
