        Tuesday 22<sup>d</sup> In the <sup>PM</sup> had a gentle breeze at <sup>SE</sup> with which we stood in for the land <sup>SW</sup> untill 4 oClock when being <sub>^</sub><sup>in the Lat<sup>de</sup> of 24&deg;. 36' S<sup>o</sup></sup> <sup>and</sup> about 2 Leagues from land in 9 fathom water we bore away along shore <sup><small>NW</small></sup><small>BW</small> At the same time we could see the land extending to the South South East about 8 Leagues. Near the Sea the land is <sub>^</sub><sup>very</sup> low but in land are some moderatly high hills and the whole appear'd to be thickly cloathed with wood &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In runing along shore we shoald in our water from 9 to 7 fathom and at one time had but 6 fath<sup>m</sup> which determined me to anchor for the night and accordingly at 8 oClock we came too in 8 fathom water a fine gravely bottom about 5 Miles from the land. this evening we saw a water snake and 2 or 3 evenings ago one lay under the Ships stern some time &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this was about a yard and a half in length and was the first we had seen &#151;
