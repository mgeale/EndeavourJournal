        Light gentle breezes and clear weather. P.M. saw one of the same sort of Birds as we saw last saturday, these Birds are of a dark brown or Chocolate colour with some white feathers under their wings and are as big as ravens; M<sup>r</sup> Gore says that they are in great plenty <sub>^</sub> <sup>at Port Egmont in</sup> <strike>about</strike> Faulklands Isl<sup>ds</sup> and for that reason calles them Port Egmont Hens. Saw a great many <strike>posse</strike> <sup>Porposes</sup> large and small the small ones had White bellies and noses &#151; <small>AM</small> Saw 2 Port Egmont Hens a seal, some Sea weed and a peice of wood, with Barnacles upon it, <strike>this shews that it must have been some time in the water &#151;</strike>
