        Friday 8<sup>th</sup> Winds at <small>SSE</small> and South first part light airs the remainder a gentle breeze &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the <small>PM</small> we saw several large smooks upon the main, some people Canoes, and as we thought Cocoa-nutt Trees upon one of the Islands, and as <sub>^</sub><sup>a</sup> few of these nutts would have been very acceptable to us at this Time I sent Lieut<sup>t</sup> Hicks a Shore with whome went M<sup>r</sup> Banks and D<sup>r</sup> Solander to see what was to be got, in the mean time we kep standing in for the Island with the Ship - At 7 oClock they returnd on board having met with nothing worth observing &nbsp;the trees we saw were a small kind of Cabbage Palm<sup>s</sup>, they heard some of the Natives as they were puting off from the shore but saw none. &nbsp;After the boats were hoisted in we <strike>made sail</strike> stood away <small><sub>^</sub><small>NBW</small></small> for the northermost land we had in sight which we were abreast off at 3 oClock in the Morning having passed all the Islands 3 or 4 hours before; this point I have named Point Hillick on accout of its Figure &#151;

        The Land of this Point is tolerable high and may be known <br> by a round hillick or rock that appears to be detatched <br> from the Point but I beleive it joins to it. Between <br> this Cape and <strike>Cape</strike> Iron Head the Shore forms a large <br> Bay which I named R<u>ockingham</u> Bay &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before it lay <br> the group of Islands before mentioned and some <br> others nearer the shore. These Islands <strike>cover</strike> <sup>shelter</sup> the bay in <br> a manner from all winds, in which is good anchorage <br> the land near the shore in the bottom of this bay is <br> very low and woody, but a little way <strike>in land</strike> <sup>back in the Country</sup> is a continued <br> ridge of high land which appear'd to be barren and <br> rocky. Having passed Point Hillick we continued <br> standing to the <small>NNW</small> as the land trended having the <br> advantage of a light moon - At 6 oClock in the <small>AM</small> we <br> were a breast of a point of Land which lies <small>NBW<small>1/2</small>W<br> </small>11 Miles from Point Hillick &nbsp;&nbsp;the Land between them is <br> very high and of a craggy barren surface&nbsp;&nbsp; this point <br> I named Cape Sandwich <sub>^</sub><sup>Honour ye Earl of that name</sup> It it may not only be known <br> by the high craggy land over it but by a small Island <br> which lies East one mile from it and some others about <br> two leagues to the northward <sub>^</sub><sup>of</sup> it - From Cape Sandwich <br> the land trends west and afterwards north and forms <br> a fine large Bay which <sub>^</sub><sup>I call'd Halifax Bay it </sup> is well shelterd and affords <br> good anchorage, at least so it appeard to me, for having <br> hitherto met with so little incouragement by goin a Shore <br> that I would not wait to land or examine it f<strike>a</strike>urther <br> <br> but continued rainging along shore to the northward for a parcel of small Islands laying off the northern point of the Bay and finding a channel <sub>^</sub><sup>of a Mile broad</sup> between the three outermost and those nearer the shore we pushed through - while we did this we saw on one of the <sup>nearest</sup> Islands a number of the natives collicted together who seem'd to look very attentively upon the ship. they were quite naked and of a very dark Colour with short <strike>curled or frizled</strike> hair &#151; At noon we were by observation in the Lat<sup>de</sup> of 17&deg;..59' and a breast of the north point of <strike>point of</strike> Halifax Bay which bore from us west 2 Miles, &nbsp;this boundry of the bay is form'd by a tolerable high Island known <sub>^</sub><sup>in the Chart</sup> by the name of Dunk Isle &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it lays so near the shore as not to be distinguished from it unless you are well in with the land - at this time we were in the Longitude of 213&deg;..57' W<sup>t</sup> Cape Sandwich bore <small>SBE<small>1/2</small>E</small> distant 19 Miles and the northermost land in sight <small>N</small> <small><small>1/2</small>W</small> &#151; our depth of water in the Course of this days sail was not more then 16 nor less then 7 fathom
