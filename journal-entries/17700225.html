        Sunday 25<sup>th</sup> In the <small>PM</small> steerd <small>SWBS</small> and <small>SW</small> edging in for the land having the advantage of a fresh gale at north which I was over desirious of makeing the most of and by that means carried away the Main Top g<sup>t</sup> mast and Fore topmast studding sail boom, but these were soon replaced by others. Altho we kept at no great distance from the shore yet the weather was so hazey that we could see nothing destinct upon the land only that there were a ridge of pretty high hills lying parallel with and but a little way from the sea-coast which lies <small>SBW</small> and <small>NBE</small> and seem'd to end in a high bluff point to the Southward which we run the length of by 8 oClock, when being dark and not knowing which way the Land trended we brought too for the night having run 15 Leagues upon a <small>SW<small>1/2</small>S</small> Course sence noon, &nbsp;&nbsp;the point bore at this time West distant about 5 Miles, depth of water 37 fathom the bottom small pebble stones. At 4 <small>AM</small> we made sail, but by this time the northerly wind was gone and was succeeded by one from the southward which proved very variable and unsteady &#151;

        At day light the point above mention'd bore north distant 3 Leagues and we found that the land trended away from it <small>SWBW</small> as far as we could see. This point of land I have named <u>Cape Saunders</u> in Honour of S<sup>r</sup> Charles, <strike>it lies in </strike> <sub><strike>^</strike></sub><strike>the</strike> / Latitude 45&deg;..55' S<sup>o</sup> Longitude 189&deg;..4' West. / it requres no description to know it by, the Latitude and the Angle made here by the Coast will be found quite sufficient <sub>^</sub><sup>however there is a remarkable Saddle hill laying near the shore 3 or 4 Leagues SW of the Cape *</sup>. From one to four Leagues north of the Cape the shore seem'd to form two or three Bays wherein there appeared to <sub>^</sub><sup>be</sup> anchorage and Shelter from <small>SW</small>, westerly and <small>NW</small> winds. I had some thoughts of bearing up for one of these places in the morning when the wind came to <small>SW</small>, but the fear of looseing time and the desire <sub>^</sub><sup>I</sup> <strike>have</strike> <sup>had</sup> of pushing to the southward in order to see as much of the coast as possible, or if this land s[h]ould prov[e] to be an Island to get round it, prevented me. Being not far from the shore all this morning we had an oppertunity of viewing the land pretty distinctly. &nbsp;&nbsp;it is of a moderate height, full of hills which appear'd green and woody, but we saw not the least signs of Inhabitants &#151; At Noon <u>Cape Saunders</u> bore N 30&deg; W<sup>t</sup> distant 4 Leagues &nbsp;&nbsp;Lat<sup>de</sup> per Log, for we had no Observation, 46&deg;..0' S<sup>o</sup>
