        Monday 5<sup>th</sup> First part  little wind, &amp; Clowdy, middle Thunder lightning and rain, the latter little  wind at <small>SW</small> and fair - At 4 <small>AM</small>  Weighed and tow'd down the Bay / being calm / with an intent to go to Sea, but  having two Shott fired at us from Santa Cruz Fort was obliged to come to an  Anchor and to send a boat to the fort to know the reason of their fireing, who  it seems had no orders to let us pass without which no ship can go to sea. &nbsp;&nbsp;this surprise'd me not a little as I had but this very morning received a very polite  litter from the Viceroy / in answer to one I had wrote some days ago / wherein  he wishes me a good Voyage. I immediatly dispatched a Petty officer to the Viceroy to know the reason why we was not permitted to pass the Fort, the Boat very soon return'd with an order to the Cap<sup>t</sup> of the Fort to let us pass which order had been wrote some days ago, but either by design or neglect had not been sent - At a 11 weigh'd in order to put to  sea but before we could heave up the Anchor it got hold of a rock where it held  fast in spite of all our endeavours to clear it untill the Sea breeze set in  &#151;
