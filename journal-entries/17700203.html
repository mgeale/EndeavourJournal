        Saturday 3<sup>rd</sup> Winds Northerly mostly fair weather. Very early in the <small>AM</small> sent the Long-boat for sellery to boil for the Ships compneys breakfasts and as I intended sailing the first oppertunity I went over to the Hippa which is on the East side of the Sound and purchas'd of the Inhabitants a quantaty of split and half dry'd fish and such as I could get. While we were at this hippa <strike>Tobia</strike> Tupia made farther enquirey about the <u>land</u>s and <u>stra</u>it and these people confirm'd every thing the old man had before told us. About noon we took our leave of them, which some seem'd not sorry for, for notwithstanding they sold us their fish very freely, there were some few among them who shew'd evident signs of disaprobation.
