        [check MS] Sunday 17th Most part strong gales at SE with some heavy showers of rain in the PM. At 6 in the AM being pretty moderate we weigh'd and run in to the Harbour in doing of which we run the Ship a shore twice &nbsp;&nbsp;the first time she went off without any trouble but the second time She stuck fast, but this was of no concequence any farther then giving us a little trouble and was <strike>no</strike> no more than what I expected as we had the wind - While the Ship lay fast we got down the fore yard Fore topmast booms &amp;C<sup>a</sup> over board and made a raft of them along side &#151;
