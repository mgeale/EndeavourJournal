        Wednesday 19<sup>th</sup> <small>P.M.</small> Variable light airs and clear weather, the trading party had better Success to day then yesterday. A.M. A Gentle breeze at <small>SE</small>. As it was known to the natives that we intended to sail to day, Oree the Chief and several more came on board to take their leave of us.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the chief was given a small plate on which was stamp'd the following Inscription viz. His Britannick Maj. Ship Endeavour, Lieut<sup>t</sup> Cook Commander 16<sup>th</sup> July 1769. Huaheine. This was accompanied with some Medals or Counters of the English coine struck 1761. &nbsp;&nbsp;together with some other presents, all these but more particularly the plate the Cheif promised never to part with; this we thought would prove as lasting a Testimony of our having first discover'd this Island as any we could leave behind. &nbsp;&nbsp;after this was done they were dismiss'd and w[e] began to prepare to leave the place but as that falls out on the following day I shall conclude this with a discription of the Island which is situated in the Latitude of 16&deg;..43' S<sup>o</sup> and Longitude 150&deg;..52' West from Greenwich and North 58&deg; West distant 31 Leagues from King Georges Island or Otaheite. It is about 7 Leagues in compass and of a Hilly and uneven surface. it hath a safe and commodious Harbour which lies on the west side under the northermost high land and with<sub>^</sub><sup>in</sup> the north end of the reef which lays along that side of the Island; into this Harbour are two inlets or openings in the reef about 1<small>1/2</small> Mile from each other, the southermost is the broadest on the <small>S<sup>o</sup></small> side of which is a very small sandy Island. This Harbour is called by the natives Ohwarhe &#151;

        The produce of this Island is in all respects the same as King Georges Island and the manners and customs of the inhabitants much the same only that they are not addicted to stealing, and with respect to <strike>complexion</strike> Colour, they are rather fairer than the natives of Georges Island and the whole more uniformly of one Colour &#151;
