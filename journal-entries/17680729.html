        <p>
        
        Moderate and fair weather, at 11 am hoisted the Pendant, and took charge of the Ship agreeable to my Commission of the 25.<sup>th</sup> Instant, She Lying in the Bason in Deptford Yard. From this day to the 21<sup>st</sup> of July we  were constantly employed in fitting the Ship, takeing on board stores  and Provisions, &amp;c<sup>a.</sup> <strike>the next day</strike> when we saild from Deptford and anchor'd in Gallions reach, were we remain'd until the 30th. The transactions of each day both while we lay here and at Deptford, are inserted in the Logg Book and as they contain nothing but common Occurrences it was thought  not necessary to insert <sub>^</sub> <sup>them</sup> here.
