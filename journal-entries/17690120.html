        Friday 20<sup>th</sup> Moderate  gales and clowdy with frequent showers of rain all this day: this evening the  Surf abated and at 2 <small>AM</small> sent the People on  shoar to Wood and water and cut brooms all of which we compleated this day &#151;&nbsp;  in this service we lost our small Kedge anchor, it having been laid off the  watering place to ride the Long boat by, and the gale had brok a way the Hawser  and Buoy rope, and perhaps buried the anchor in the sand, for notwithstanding  our utmost endeavour We were not able to hook it &#151;
