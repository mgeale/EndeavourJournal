        Friday 10<sup>th</sup> Fresh gales at <small>SSE</small> and <small>SEBS</small>. In the <small>PM</small> the wind fell so as we got up the small bower Anchor and hove in to a whole Cable on the best bower. At 3 oClock in the morning we got up the lower yards and at 7 weigh'd and stood in for the land <sub>^</sub><sup>/ intending to seek a passage along shore to the northward /</sup> having a Boat ahead sounding, depth of water as we run in from 19 to 12 fathom: after standing in an hour we edge'd away for 3 small Island that lay <small>NNE<small>1/2</small>E</small> 3 Leagues from Cape Bedford, to these Islands the Master had been in the Pinnace when the Ship was in Port; At 9 oClock we were abreast of them and between them and the Main having another low Island between us and the latter which lies <small>WNW</small>, 4 Miles from the Three Island in this Channell had 14 fathom water: the northermost Point of the Main we had in sight bore from us <small>NNW<small>1/2</small>W</small> distant 2 Leagues. Four or 5 Leagues to the <small>NE</small> of this head <strike>lad</strike> land appear'd three high Islands with some smaller ones near them and the Shoals and reefs without us we could see extending to the northward as far as these Islands: we directed our Course between them and the above headland <sub>^</sub><sup>leaving a small I<sup>d</sup> to the Eastw<sup>d </sup>of us which lies <small>NBE</small> 4 M. from ye 3 I<sup>ds</sup></sup> having all the while a boat ahead sounding. At Noon we were got betwixt the headland and the 3 High Islands distant from the former 2 and from the latter 4 Leagues, our Latitude by observation was 14&deg;..51' S<sup>t</sup> We now judged our selves to be clear of all danger having as we thought a clear open sea before us, but this we soon found otherwise and occasiond my calling the headland above mentioned Cape Flattery &#151;&#151; / Latitude 14&deg;..55' S<sup>t</sup> Long<sup>d</sup> 214&deg; 43' West / it is a lofty Promontary makeing in two hills next the Sea and a third behind them with low sandy land on each side, but it is better known by the Three high Islands out at sea the northermost which is the largest and lies from the Cape <small>NNE</small> distant 5 Leagues - From this Cape the Mainland trends away <small>NW</small> &amp; <small>NWBW</small> &#151;
