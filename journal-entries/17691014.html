        Saturday 14<sup>th</sup> <small>P.M.</small> had gentle breezes betwe<sub>^</sub><sup>e</sup>n the <small>NE</small> and <small>NW</small>. Kept runing down along shore at the distance of two or 3 Miles off &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our sounding was from 20 to 13 fathom an even sandy bottom. We saw some canoes or boats in shore and several houses upon the land, but no harbour or convenient watering place.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the main thing <sub>^</sub><sup>we</sup> were looking for. In the night had little wind and sometimes Calm with dirty rainy weather. AM had <sub>^</sub><sup>Variable</sup> light <sub>^</sub><sup>airs</sup> next to a Calm and fair weather. In the Morning being not above two Leagues from the <small>SW.</small> Cod of the great Bay we have been in for these 2 days past, the Pinnace and Long boat were hoisted out in order to search for fresh water; but just as they were ready to put off we observe'd several Boats full of People coming <strike>coming</strike> off from the shore and for that reason <sub>^</sub><sup>I</sup> did not think it prudent to send our own from the Ship; the first that came were five in number in <strike>that was</strike> <sub>^</sub> <sup>them were</sup> between 80 and 90 Men. &nbsp;every method was tried to gain their friend Ship and several things were thrown over board to them, but all we could do was to no purpose neither would they accept of any one thing from us but seem'd fully bent on attacking us &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in order to prevent this and our being obliged to fire upon them. I order'd a 4 pounder load with Grape to be fire'd a little wide of them, leting them know at the same time by means of <strike>Tobia</strike> Tupia what we <strike>was</strike> were going to do, this had the desired effect and not one of these would afterwards trust themselves abreast of the Ship. soon after four more came off. one of these put what arms they had into a nother boat and then came along side so near as to take what things we gave them, and I believe might have been prevail'd upon to come on board had not some of the first 5 come up under our stern and begun again to t[h]reaten us at which the people in this one boat seem'd displeased &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;emmediatly after this they all went a Shore.

        At Noon Lat. In per Observation 39&deg;..37' S<sup>t</sup> Portland bore by our run from it <small>EBN</small> Dist. 14 Leagues, the southermost land in sight <sub>^</sub><sup>and which is the south point of the Bay</sup> <small>SEBS</small>. distant 4 or 5 Leagues, and a bluff head lying in the <small>S.W.</small> Cod of the Bay, <small>SBW</small>. 2 or 3 Miles. &nbsp;&nbsp;on each side of this bluf head is a low <sub>^</sub><sup>narrow</sup> sand<strike>y</strike> or stone beach, between these beaches and the main land is a pretty large lake of salt water as I suppose; on the <small>SE</small> side of this head is a very Large Flat, which seems to extend a good way in land to the westward, on this flat are several Groves of Streight, tall trees; but there seems to be a great probability that the lake above mention'd extends it self a good way into this flat country. Inland are a chain of pretty high mountains extending <small>N</small>. and <small>S</small><sup>t</sup> on the sumets and sides of these mountains <strike>are</strike> were ma<sub>^</sub><sup>n</sup>y patches of snow, but between them and the Sea the Land is Cloathed with Wood &#151;
