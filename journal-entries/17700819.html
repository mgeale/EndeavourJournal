        Sunday 19<sup>th</sup> Gentle breezes at <small>SEBE</small> and clear weather&nbsp;&nbsp; At 2 oClock in the <small>PM</small> <sub>^</sub><sup>as we were steering <small><small>NW</small></small><small>BN</small></sup> saw a large shoal right ahead extending 3 or 4 Points on each bow upon which we hauld up <small>NNE</small> and <small>NEBN</small> in order to get round the North Point of it which we reached by 4 oClock and than edged away to the westward and run between the north end of this shoals and a nother which lays 2 miles to the northward of it having a boat all the time ahead of the Ship sound.g our depth of water was very erregular from 22 to 8 fathoms &nbsp;At <small>1/2</small> past 6 oClock we Anchor'd in 13 fathom, the northermost of the small Islands mentioned at Noon bore <small>W<small>1/2</small>S</small> distant 3 Miles, these Islands, which are known in the Chart by the name of Forbes's Isles, lay about 5 Leagues from the Main which here forms a moderatly high Point <sub>^</sub><sup>which we call'd Bolt head</sup> from which the land trends more westerly and is all low <strike>l</strike>Sandy land but to the southward it is high and hilly even near the Sea. At 6 oClock in the <small>AM</small> we got again under sail and directed our Course for an Island which lay but a little way from the Main and bore from us at this time N.40&deg; W<sup>t</sup> distant 5 Leagues, but we were soon interrupted in our course by meeting with Shoals, but by the help of two Boats ahead and a good lookout at the Mast head we got at last into a fair Channel which lead us down to the Island having a very large shoal on our starboard side and several smaller ones betwixt us and the Main land, in this Channell we had from 20 to 30 fathom water - Between a 11 and 12 oClock we hauld round the <small>NE</small> side of the Island leaving it between us and the Main from which it is distant 7 or 8 Miles, this Island is about a League in circuit and of a Moderate height and is Inhabited; to the <small>NW</small> of it are several small low Islands and Keys which lay not far from the Main and to the northward and Eastward lay several other Islands and shoals so that we were now incompass'd on every side by one or the other, <sub>^</sub><sup>but so much does great danger Swallow up lesser ones that these once so much dreaded Shoals were now looke'd <strike>upon</strike> at with less concearn</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;The Boats being out of their stations we brought too to wait for them. At Noon our Latitude by observation was 12&deg;.0' S<sup>t</sup> Longitude in 217&deg;..25 West depth of Water 14 fathom Course and distant saild reduce'd to a strait line sence yesterday Noon is N 29&deg; West 32 Miles. &#134;

        &#134; <sup>The Main land within the above Islands forms a point which I call Cape Grenville / Lat<sup>de</sup> 11&deg;..58', Long<sup>de</sup> 217&deg;.38' / between this Cape and the Bolt head is a Bay which I named Temple Bay. <small>E<small>1/2</small>N</small> 9 Leagues from Cape Granvill lay some tolerable high Islands which I call'd S<sup>r</sup> Charles Hardys Isles, those which lay off the Cape I named Cockburns Isles </sup>
