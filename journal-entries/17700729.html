        Sunday 29<sup>th</sup> Winds at <small>SE</small> a fresh breeze untill 5 <small>AM</small> at which time it fell Calm and soon after had a light breeze from the land, upon this I sent a boat to see what water was upon the bar / it being 2 hours ebb / and hove up the Anchor in order to put to sea, but upon the return of the boat came too again as there were only 13 feet <sub>^</sub><sup>water upon the bar</sup> which was 6 Inches less water then what the Ship draw'd. after this I sent the Yawl to look for turtle as those we had got before were nearly all expended, about 8 oClock the sea breeze set in again which put an end to our sailing this day after which I sent the Pinnace to haul the Sain who returnd with only 20 pounds of fish &#151;
