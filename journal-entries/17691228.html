        Thursday 28<sup>th</sup> The gale continued without the least intermission untill 2 <small>AM</small> when the wind fell a little and began to veer to the Southward and to <small>SW</small> where it fix'd at 4, and <strike>we set the fore</strike> <sub>^</sub><sup>made</sup> sail and steer'd East in for the land under the Foresail and main-sail but was soon obliged to take in the latter as it began to blow very hard and increased in such a manner that by 8 oClock it was a meer hurricane <sub>^</sub><sup>attended with rain</sup> and the Sea run prodigious high, at this time we wore the Ship haul'd up the Fore-sail and brought her too with her head to the <small>NW</small> under a reef'd Main-sail, but this was scarce done before the Main tack gave way and we were glad to take in the Main sail and lay under the Mizen stay-sail and Ballance'd Mizen, after which we reef'd the Fore-sail and furl'd both it and the Main-sail. At Noon the gale was a little abated, but had still heavy squalls attended with rain - Our Course made good to day is North <sub>^</sub><sup>a little easterly</sup> 29 miles.
