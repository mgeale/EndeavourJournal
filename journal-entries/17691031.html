        Tuesday, 31<sup>st</sup> At half past one <small>PM</small> ha<sub>^</sub><sup>u</sup>led round the Island above mentioned which lies East one mile from the <small>NE</small> Point of the land, the land from hence trends <small>NWBW</small> and <small>WNW</small> as far as we could see. This point of land I have called <strike>Cape East</strike> <sup>East Cape</sup> because I have great reason to think that it is the Eastermost land on this whole coast, and for the same reason I have called the Island which lays of[f] it East Island, it is but of a small circuit high and round and appears white and barren. The Cape is of a moderate height with white Clifts, and lies in the Latitude of 37&deg;..42'..30" South and Longitude 181&deg; 00' West from the Meridion of Greenwich &#151;
        
        <p>
        
        After we had rounded the East Cape we saw as we run along shore a great number of Villages and a great deal of Cultivated land and in general the Country appeard with more fertility <strike>that</strike> <sup>than</sup> what we had seen before, it was low near the sea but hilly inland. At 8 being 8 Leagues to the Westward of Cape East and 3 or 4 Miles from the shore shortend sail and brought too for the night having at this time <sub>^</sub><sup>a</sup> fresh gale <sub>^</sub><sup>at</sup> <small>SSE</small> and squally weather; but it soon fell Moderate and At 2 <small>A.M.</small> made sail again to the SW as the land now trended - At 8 saw land which made like an Island bearing west &nbsp;&nbsp;at the same time the <small>SW</small>estermost part of the Main land bore <small>SW</small>. &#151;
        
        <p>
        
        At 9 Five Canoes came off to us, in one of which <strike>was</strike> were upwards of 40 Men all Arm'd with Pikes &amp;C<sup>a</sup> - from this and other circumstances it fully appear'd that they came with no friendly intention, and I at this Time being very busey and had no inclination to stay upon deck to watch their motions, I order'd a grape shot to be fired a little wide of them. This made them pull off a little and then they got together either to consu<sub>^</sub><sup>l</sup>t what to do or to look about them &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon this I order'd a <strike>fire</strike> round shot to be fired over their heads which frightend them to that degree that I believe they did not think them selves safe untill they got a shore, &nbsp;&nbsp;this occasion'd our calling the point of land off which this Happen'd <u>Cape Runaway</u> / Lat<sup>de</sup> 37&deg;..32' Long<sup>de</sup> 181&deg;..50 / and 17 or 18 Leagues to the westward of East Cape &#151;
        
        <p>
        
        Four Leagues to the westward of the East Cape is a Bay which I have named <u>Hicks's Bay</u> because Lieutenant Hicks was the first who discover'd it &#151;
