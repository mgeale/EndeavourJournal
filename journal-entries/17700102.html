        Tuesday 2<sup>d</sup> Fresh breezes at <small>SSW</small> and West accompan'd with a rowling Sea from the <small>SW</small> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 5 <small>PM</small> the wind veering to the westward we tack'd and stood to the Southward. at this time the North Cape bore <small>E<small>3/4</small>N</small> and was just open of a point that lies 3 Leagues west and by south from it <strike>and this is what I suppose Tasman calls Cape Maria Van Dieman a name I shall not continue in my map but shall comprehend under the name of the North Cape &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Whole of the point of this Peninsula;</strike> being now well assured that <strike>it is</strike> the Northermost extremity of this Country and is <sub>^</sub><sup>the East point of</sup> a Peninsula <sub>^</sub><sup>which</sup> stretches out <small>NW</small> and <small>NWBN</small>, 17 or 18 Leag<sup>s</sup> and as I have before observe'd is for the most part low and narrow except its extremity where the land is tollerable high and extends <strike>5</strike> <sup>4 or 5</sup> Leagues every <strike>way, the middle of it being in the Longitude of</strike>  <sup>way, Cape Maria Vandeimen is the west point of this peninsula and lies in the Latitude of 34&deg; 30' Long<sup>de</sup> 187&deg; 18'</sup> West from Greenwich <strike>and the most northermost point lies in the Latitude of 34&deg; 22' South</strike> From this <strike>westermost part of the</strike> Cape the land trends away <small>SEBS</small> and <small>SE</small> to and behond Mount Camel <sub>&#151; &#151; &#151;</sub> and is everywhere a barren shore affording no better a prospect than what ariseth from white sand banks. At <small>1/2</small> past 7 <small>PM</small> the Islands of the Three Kings bore <small>NWBN</small> and <strike>the west part of the North Cape</strike> <sup>Cape Maria Van diemen</sup> <small>NEBE</small> dist<sup>t</sup> 4 Leagues. At 5 <small>AM</small> <strike>the North Cape</strike> C Maria Vandeemen bore <small>NNE<small>1/2</small>E</small> and Mount Camel &#151; <strike>bore</strike> East - At Noon was in the Lat<sup>d</sup> of 35&deg;.17' and the <strike>north</strike> Cape <sub>^</sub><sup>Maria Van diemen</sup> by judgment bore North distant 16 Leagues having no land in sight not daring to go near it as the wind blow'd fresh right on Shore and a high rowling Sea from the same quarter, and knowing that there was no harbour that we could put into in case we were caught upon a lee shore &#151;
