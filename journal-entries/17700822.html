        Wednesday 22<sup>d</sup> Gentle breezes at <small>EBS</small> and clear weather. We had not stood above 3 or 4 Miles along shore to the westward . before we discover'd the Land ahead to be Islands detach'd by several channells from the Main land, upon this we brought too to wait for the yawl and called the other boats on board, and after giving <sub>^</sub><sup>them proper Instructions</sup> sent them away again to lead us through the Channell next the Main, and as soon as the yawl was on board made sail with the Ship after them; soon after we discoverd Rocks, <sup>&amp;</sup> shoals in this Channell upon which <sub>^</sub><sup>I</sup> made the Signal for the boats to lead through the next Channel to the Northward laying between the Islands which they accordingly did we following with the Ship and had not less than 5 fathom water and this <strike>was</strike> in the narrowest part of the Channell which was about a Mile and a half broad from Island to Island. &nbsp;&nbsp;At 4 oClock we anchor'd about a Mile and a half or 2 Miles within the entrance in 6<small>1/2</small> fathom clear ground distant from the Islands on each side of us one mile, the Main<strike>d</strike> land extending away to the SW, the farthest point of which that we could see bore from us S<sup>t</sup> 48&deg; West and the South-wester-most point of the Islands on the <small>NW</small> side of the Passage bore S<sup>t</sup> 76&deg; West &nbsp;&nbsp;between these two points we could see no land so that we were in great hopes that we had at last found out a Passage into the <strike>into the</strike> Indian seas, but in order to be better informd I land<sub>^</sub><sup>ed</sup> with a party of Men accompan'd by M<sup>r</sup> Banks and D<sup>r</sup> Solander <strike>and land</strike> upon the Island which lies at the <small>SE</small> point of the Passage: before and after we <strike>landed</strike> <sup>Anchor'd</sup> we saw a number of People upon this Island arm'd in the same - manner as all the others we have seen except one man who had a bow and a bundle of Arrows &nbsp;&nbsp;the first we have seen on this coast. from the appearence of these People we expected they would have opposed our landing but as we approached the Shore they all made off and left us in peaceable posession of as much of the Island as served our purpose. After landing I went upon the highest hill which however was of no great height, yet not less than twice or thrice the height of the Ships Mast heads but I could see from it no land between <small>SW</small> and <small>WSW</small> so that I did not doubt but there was a passage, I could see plainly that the Lands laying to the <small>NW</small> of this passage were composed of a number of Island of various extent both for height and circuit rainged one be hind a nother as far to the Northward and Westward as I could see which could not be less than 12 or 14 Leagues. Having satisfied myself of the great Probabillity of a Passage, thro' which I intend going with the Ship and there<sup>for</sup> may land no more upon this <strike>Western</strike> Eastern coast of <u>New Holland</u> &nbsp;&nbsp;and on the Western side I can make no new discovery the honour of which belongs to the Dutch Navigators <strike>and as such they may lay claim to it as their property</strike> but the Eastern Coast from the Latitude of 38&deg; South down to this place I am confident was never seen or viseted by any European before <sub>^</sub><sup>us and</sup> <strike>therefore by the same Rule belongs to great Brittan</strike> Notwithstand I had in the Name of his Majesty taken posession of several places upon this coast I now once more hoisted English Coulers and in the Name of His Majesty King George the Third took posession of the whole Eastern Coast from the above Latitude down to this place by the Name of New South <sub>^</sub><sup>Wales</sup> together with all the Bays, Harbours Rivers and Islands situate upon the <strike>same</strike> <sup>said</sup> coast &nbsp;&nbsp;after which we fired three Volleys of small Arms which were Answerd by the like number <strike>by</strike> <sup>from</sup> the Ship &nbsp;&nbsp;this done we set out for the Ship but were some time in geting on board on accout of a very rappid Ebb Tide which set <small><sub>^</sub><small>NE</small></small> out of the Passage <strike>away to the <small>NE</small> </strike>&nbsp;&nbsp;ever sence we came in among the Shoals this last time we have found a Moderate Tide the Flood seting to the <small>NW</small> and Ebb to the <small>SE</small>. at this place it is High-water at the Full and Change of the Moon about 1 or 2 o'Clock and riseth and falls upon a perpendicular about 10 or 12 feet. We saw on all the Adjacent Lands and Islands a great number of smooks a certain sign that they are Inhabited and we have dayly seen smooks on every part of the coast we have lately been upon &#151;

        <p>

        Between 7 and 8 oClock in the Morning we saw several naked people, all or most of them women, down upon the beach picking <sub>^</sub><sup>up</sup> Shells, &amp;C<sup>a</sup> they had not a single rag of any kind of Cloathing upon them and both these and those we saw yesterday were in every respect the Same sort of people we have seen every where upon the Coast; two or three of the Men we saw Yesterday had on pretty large breast plates which we supposed were made of Pearl Oysters Shells this was a thing as well as the Bow and Arrows we had not seen before &#151;

        <p>

        At Low-water which happend about 10 oClock we got under sail and stood to the <small>SW</small> with a light breeze at East which afterwards veerd to <small>NBE</small>, having the Pinnace a head, depth of water from 6 to 10 fathom except in one place where we pass'd over a bank of 5 fathom &#151;
