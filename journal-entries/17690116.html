        Monday 16 A Fresh breeze of Wind at South and <small>S.W.</small>  with frequent Showers of Snow and rain - &nbsp;&nbsp;at 2 <small>PM</small>  Anchor'd in the Bay of Success, in 9 fathom the bottom owse and sand, the south  point of the Bay bore <small>SE</small> and the North Point  <small>ENE</small>. This Bay I shall describe when I come  to speake of the rest of the coast - &nbsp;&nbsp;hoisted out the Boats, and  Moor'd with the Stream Anchor, while this was doing I went a Shore accompany'd  <strike>with</strike> <sup>by</sup> M<sup>r</sup>  Banks and D<sup>r</sup> Solander to look for a Watering  Place, and to speak with the Natives who were assembled on the beach at the  head of the Bay to the number of 30 or 40; they were so far from being afraid  or surprised at our coming amongest them that three of them came on board without  the least hesitation. They are something above the Middle size of a dark copper  Colour with long black hair, they paint their bodies <sub>^</sub><sup>in</sup>  Streakes mostly Red and Black, their cloathing consists wholy <strike>and</strike>  <sub>^</sub><sup>of</sup> a Guanacoes  skin or that of a Seal, in the same form as it came from the Animals back, the  Women wear <strike>of</strike> a peice of skin over their  privey parts but the Men observe no such decency&nbsp;&nbsp; their Hutts are  made like a behive and open on one side where they have their fire, they are  made of small Sticks and cover'd with branches of trees, Long grass &amp;C<sup>a</sup>  in such a manner that they are neither proff against Wind, Hail, rain or snow,  a sufficient proff that these People must be a very hardy race; they live chiefly  on shell fish such as Muscles, which they gather from off the rock, along the  sea- shore and this seems to be the work of the Women; their arms are Bows and  Arrows neatly made, their arows are bearded some with glass and others with  fine flint, several pieces of the former we saw amongst them with other European  things such as Rings, Buttons, Cloth, Canvas &amp;C<sup>a</sup>  which I think proves that they must sometimes travel to the Northward as we  know of no ship that hath been in those parts for many years, besides they were  not at all surprised at our fire arms, on the contrary seem'd to know the use  of them by making signs to us to fire at Sea<sub>^</sub><sup>l</sup>s  or Birds that might come in the way&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;they have no boats that  we saw, or anything to go upon the water with &#151;&nbsp;&nbsp;their number  doth not exceed 50 or 60 young and old and there are fewer Women then Men.&nbsp;&nbsp;  they are extreamly fond of any Red thing and seemed to set more Value on Beeds  than any thing we could give them: in this consists their whole pride, few either  men or Women are without a necklace or string of Beeds made of small Shells  or bones about their necks &#151;

        They would not taste any strong Liquor, neither did they seem  fond of our provisions- &nbsp;&nbsp;we could not discover that they had any  head or chief, or form of Government, neither have they any usefull or necessary  Utentials except it be a Bagg <sub>^</sub><sup>or  Basket</sup> to gather their Muscels into: in a Word they are perhaps as miserable  a set of People as are this day upon Earth &#151;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having found a  convenient place on the <small>S</small><sup>o</sup>  side of the Bay to wood and Water at, we set about that work in the morning,  and M<sup>r </sup>Banks with a Party went into the Country  to gather Plants &amp;C<sup>a</sup>
