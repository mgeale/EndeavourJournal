        Saturday 10<sup>th</sup> <small>PM</small> Moderate breeze at <small>NWBN</small> and north with which we stood close upon a Wind to the westward &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At sunset the Southermost point of land which I <strike>have</strike> <sub>^</sub><sup>afterwards</sup> named <sup>South Cape and which lies in the Lat<sup>de</sup> of 47&deg;..19' S, Long<sup>d</sup> 192&deg;..12 West from Greenwich</sup> bore N 38&deg; E<sup>t</sup> distant 4 Leagues and the westermost land in sight bore N<sup>o</sup> 2&deg; East: this last was a small Isl<sup>d</sup> lying off the point of the Main. I began now to think that this was the southermost land and that we should be able to get round it by the west, for we have had a large hollow <small>SW</small> ell from the <small>SW</small> ever sence we had the last gale of wind from that quarter which makes me think that there is no land in that direction &#151;

        In the night it began to blow in so much that at <sub>^</sub><sup>or</sup> before day light we were brought under our two Courses, but at 8 <small>AM</small> it fell moderate and we set the topsails close reef'd and the Miz<sup>n</sup> and Miz<sup>n</sup> staysail being split we unbent them and bent others. At Noon the wind coming to west we tack'd and stood to the northward. having no land in sight - our Latitude by Observation was 47&deg;..33' S<sup>o</sup> Long<sup>de</sup> west from the South Cape 0&deg;..59' &#151;
