        Monday 2<sup>d</sup> D<sup>o</sup> Weather. In the <small>PM</small> the fishing party caught as much fish as came to 2 pound a man &nbsp;&nbsp;those that were in the Country met with nothing new &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early in the <small>AM</small> I sent the Master in the Pinnace out of the Harbour to Sound about the Shoals in the offening and to look for a Channel to the northward. &nbsp;&nbsp;at this time we had a breeze of wind from the land which continued till about 9 oClock, what makes me mention this is because it is the first land breeze we have had sence we have been in this <strike>harbour</strike> River &#151; At low-water lashed some empty Casks under the Ships bows being in some hopes of floating her the next high-water and sent some hands afishing while others were employ'd in refiting the Ship &#151;
