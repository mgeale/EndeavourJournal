        Thursday 19<sup>th</sup> In the <sup>PM</sup> had fresh gales at <small>SSW</small> and Clowdy Squaly weather with a large Southerly Sea - At 6 took in the Topsails and at 1 <sup>AM</sup> brought too and sounded but had no ground with 130 fathoms of line - At 5 Set the Topsails Close reef'd and 6 saw land extending from <sup>NE</sup> to West at the distance of 5 or 6 Leagues having 80 fathom water a fine sandy bottom &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We continued Standing to the westward <sub>^</sub><sup>with the wind at <small>SSW</small></sup> untill 8 oClock at which time we got topg<sup>t</sup> yards aCross made all sail, and bore away along shore <sup>NE</sup> for the Eastermost land we had in sight, being at this time in the Latitude of 37&deg;..58' S<sup>o</sup> and Long<sup>d</sup> of 210&deg;..39' West. the Southermost Point of land we had in sight which bore from us <small>W<small>1/4</small>S</small> I judged to lay in the Latitude of 38&deg;..0' S<sup>o</sup> and in the Longitude of 211&deg;..07' W<sup>t</sup> from the Meridion of Greenwich. I have named it Point Hicks, because Leuit<sup>t</sup> Hicks was the first who discover'd this land &#151;

        To the Southward of this point we could see no land and yet <sup>it</sup> was very clear in that quarter and by our Longitude compared with that of  <u>Tasmans</u> the body of Vandiemens land ought to <strike>lay</strike> <sup>have been</sup> due south from us and from the soon falling of the Sea after the wind abated I had reason to think it did.  but as we did not see it and finding this coast to trend <small>NE</small>  and <small>SW</small> or rather more to the westward makes me doubtfull whether they are land or no: however every one who compares this Journal with that of <u>Tasman</u> will be as good a judge  I am but it is  necessary to observe that I do not take the situation of Vandiemens from the printed charts but from the extract of Tasman's Journal published by Dirk Rembrantse &#151;

        At Noon we were in the Lat<sup>d</sup> of 37&deg; 50' and Long<sup>d</sup> of 210..29<small>W</small><sup>t</sup> the extremes of the land extending from <small>NW</small> to <small>ENE</small> are mark<strike>er</strike>able <strike>point</strike>
