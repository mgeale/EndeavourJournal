        Saturday 9<sup>th</sup> <small>PM</small> had a gentle breeze at West which in the evening came to south and continued so all night, this by day light in the Morning brought us pretty well in with the land 7 Leagues to the westward of the Cavalle Isles and where lies a deep Bay runing in <small>SWBW</small> and <small>WSW</small>, the bottom of which we could but just see<sub>^</sub> <sup>and there the land appear'd to be low and level&#151;</sup>; the two points which form the entrence lie<small> <strike>WSW</strike> </small><small>WNW</small> and <sup><strike>ENE</strike> <small>ESE</small></sup> 5 Miles from each other. This Bay I have named <u>Doubtless Bay</u>
        
        <p>
        
        The wind not permiting us to look into this Bay we steer'd for the westermost land we had in sight - which bore from us <small>WNW</small> distant 3 Leagues but before we got the length of it, it fell calm and continued so untill 10 oClock, when a breeze sprung up at West ^<sup>NW</sup> and with it we stood off North. While we lay becalm'd several of the Natives came off to the Ship in five Canoes, but were fearfull of ventering along side, after these were gone Six more more came off these last came boldly along side and sold us fish of different sorts sufficient to give all hands a little &#151;

        At Noon the Cavalle Isles bore <small>SEBE</small> distant 8 Leagues and the Entrence of <u>Doubtless Bay</u> <small>SBW</small> distant 3 Leagues, and the nor-west extremity of the land in sight, which we judge to be the Main bore <small>NWBW</small>. Our Latitude by obser<sup>n</sup> was 34&deg;..44' S<sup>o</sup> &#151;
