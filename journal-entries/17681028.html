        Fresh Breeze and fine clear weather.  At a little past 1<small> AM</small> Long.<sup>d</sup>  in by the three following observations / viz./ by the Moon and <sub>^</sub>  <sup>the * </sup>Arietis, 32&deg;.. 27' 0", by the moon and  Pollux, 32&deg; 0' 15", by D.<sup>o</sup> 31&deg;.. 48'.. 32";  the mean of the Whole is 32&deg;.. 5'.. 16" West from Greenwich, which is 31' more  Westerly than the Long<sup>.d</sup> by account carried  on sence the last observation. The two first observation were made and computed  by Mr Green and the last by my self. <sub>^</sub><sup>The  * </sup>Arietis was on one side of the Moon and Pollux on the other. This day  at Noon being nearly in the Lat<sup>.d</sup> of the Island  Ferdinand Noronha to the Westward of it by some charts and to the Eastward by  others, was in expectation of seeing it or some of those shoals that are laid  down in most charts between it and the main, but we saw neither one nor a nother.  We certainly pass'd to the Eastward of the Island, and as to the shoals I don't  think they exhist grounding this my opinion on the Journal of some East India  Ships I have seen, who <strike>was</strike> were detaind by  contrary winds between this Island and the main and being 5 or six Ships in  Compney, doubtless must have seen <sub>^</sub> <sup>some  of</sup> them did they lay as marked in the charts.
