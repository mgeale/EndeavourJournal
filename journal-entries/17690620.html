        Tuesday 20<sup>th</sup> Got the Powder a Shore to air, all of which we found in a bad condition and the Gunner inform's me that it was very little better when it came first on board &#151; Last night Obarea made us a Viset, who we have not seen for some time; we were told of her coming and that she would bring with her some of the Stolen things which we gave credit to because we knew - several of them were in her possession <strike>which</strike> but we were surprised to find this woman put her self wholy in our power and not bring with her one article of <strike>was</strike> what we had lost; the excuse she made was that her gallant, a Man that used to be along with her, <strike>had stolen</strike> did Steal them and she had beat him and turn'd him away; but she was so Sensible of her own guilt that she was ready to drop down through fear - and yet she had resolution enough to insist upon Sleeping in M<sup>r</sup> Bank's Tent all night and was with difficculty prevailed upon to go to her Canoe altho' no one took the least notice of her. In the morning she brought her Canoe with every thing she had to the Gate of the Fort, after which we could not help admireing her for <sub>^</sub> <sup>her Courage and</sup> the confidence she seem'd to place in us <strike>or else she depended a good deal upon what she brought with her which was</strike> <sub>^</sub> <sup>and thought that we could do no less than to receive her into favour and except the presents she had brought us which Consisted of</sup> a Hog a Dog Some Bread fruit &amp; Plantains, <strike>things we have not been over stock'd with of late</strike>: We refused to except of the Dog as being an animal we had no use for at which she seemed a little surprised and told us that it was very good eating and we very soon had an oppertunity to find that it was so, for M<sup>r</sup> Banks having bought a basket of fruit in which happend to be the thigh of a Dog ready dress'd, of this several of us taisted and found that it was meat not to be despise'd and therefore took Obarea's dog and had him immediatly <sub>^</sub> <sup>dress'd</sup> by some of the Natives in the following manner. They first made a hole in the ground about a foot deep in which they made a fire and heated some small Stones, while this was doing the Dog was Strangle'd and the hair got off by laying him frequently upon the fire, and as clean as if it had been scalded off with hot water, his intrails were taken out and the whole washed clean, and as soon as the stones and hole was sufficiently heated, the fire was put out, and part of the Stones <strike>was</strike> were left in the bottom of the hole, upon these stones were laid Green leaves and upon them the Dog together with the entrails, &nbsp;&nbsp;these were likewise cover'd with leaves and over them hot stones, and then the whole was close cover'd with mould; after he had laid here about 4 hours, the Oven / for so I must call it / was open'd and the Dog taken out whole and well done, and it was the opinion of every one who <strike>eat</strike> <sub>^</sub> <sup>taisted</sup> of it that they <strike>n</strike>Never eat sweeter meat, <strike>and</strike> we <sub>^</sub> <sup>therefore</sup> resolved for the future not to despise Dogs flesh. It is in this manner that the Natives dress, or Bake all their Victuals that require<strike>s</strike> it. Flesh, Fish and fruit &#151;

        I now gave over all thought of recovering any of the things the natives had stolen from us and therefore intend to give them up their Canoes when ever they apply for them &#151;
