        Monday 15<sup>th</sup> None of  the Ships in the Offing are yet arrived. Diserous as we must be of hearing news  from England I determine'd not to wait the arrival of these Ships, but took  the advantage of a breeze of wind from the <small>WSW</small>,  wiegh'd and stood out of the Bay - Saluted with 13 Guns which compliment was  returnd both by the Castle and Dutch Commodore, the Europa saluted us as we  pass'd her, which we returnd, this Ship was to have saild with or before us,  but not likeing the oppertunity she lay fast At 5 in the Evening Anchor'd under  Penguin or Robin Island in 10 fathom water, this <sub>^</sub><sup>Island</sup>  Extending from WNW to SSW, distant 1<small>1/2</small> or 2 Miles &#151;
        
        <p>
        
        In the Morning saw a Ship Standing into Table Bay under  English Colours which we took to be an Indiaman- At Noon Latitude Observed 33&deg;..49',  Cape Town <small>S</small><sup>o</sup>  20&deg; East distant 7 Miles. As we could not sail in the Morning for want of  wind I sent a boat to the Island for a few trifling articles we had forgot to  take in at the Cape, but the people ashore would not permit her to land so that  she return'd as she went and I gave my self no farther trouble about it, &nbsp;M<sup>r</sup>  Banks who was in the Boat was of opinion that it was owing to a mistake made  respecting the rank of the officer commanding the boat, be this as it may it  seems probable that the Dutch do not admit of strangers landing upon this Island  least they should carry off some of those people which for certain crimes they  banish here for life as we were told was done by a Dainish Ship a few years  ago. but they might have a better reason for refuseing our boat to land, for  it is not improbable but what there might be some English Seamen upon this Island  whome they had sent from the Cape while we lay there well knowing that if they  came in my way I should take them on board, and this I am told is frequently  done when any of His Majestys Ships are in the Bay, for it is well known that  the Dutch East India Ships are mostly man'd by foreigners &#151;

        The Cape of Good Hope hath been so often discrib'd by  Authors and is so well known to Europeans that any discriptions I can give of  it may appear unnecessary. however I cannot help observing that most Authors,  particularly the Author of M<sup>r</sup> Byrons Voyage,  have heighten'd the picture to a very great degree above what it will bear,  so that a stranger is at once struck with surprise and disapointment for no  Country we have seen this Voyage affords so barren a prospect as this, and not  only so in appearence but in reallity. The land over the Cape which constitutes  the Peninsula form'd by Table Bay <strike>and</strike> on  the north and False Bay on the South, consists of high barren <strike>hills</strike>  Mountains, behind these to the East or what may be call'd the Isthmus is a vast  extensive Plain, not one thousand part of which either is or can be cultivated,  the soil consists mostly of a light kind of Sea Sand <strike>and  produceth</strike> produceing hardly any thing but heath, every Inch of ground  that will bear cultivation is taken up in small Plantation consisting <sub>^</sub><sup>of</sup>  Vineyards, Orchards, Kitchen Gardens &amp;C<sup>a</sup> hardly  any two lay together, but are despers'd at some distance one from another. If  we may Judge from circumstances the Interior parts of this Country is not more  fertile that is the fertile land bears a very small proportion to the whole,  we were told that they have settlements 28 days Journey inland which is computed  at 900 English Miles, and thus far they bring provisions to the Cape <sub>^</sub><sup>by  land Carriage</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;it is also said that the Dutch farmers are  so despers'd about the Country that some have no neighbours with<sub>^</sub><sup>in</sup>  four or five days Journey of them; admiting these to be facts and it will at  once appear that the Country in general cannot be very fertile for it would  be absurd to suppose that they would raise provisions at such an emence distance,  where the trouble and expence of bringing them to market must increase in proportion,  could it be done nearer &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dutch assign another reason  for being oblige'd to extend their scater'd settlements so far inland, which  is that they never disturb the original Natives but always leave them in peaceable  posession of whatever lands they may have approbated to their own use &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which  in some places is pretty extensive and that probably none of the worst, by which  good policy the new settlers very seldom if ever meet with any disturbance from  the natives &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the Contraory <strike>they</strike>  ma<sub>^</sub><sup>n</sup>y of them  become their servants and mix among them and are usefull members to Society.  Notwithstanding the many disadvantages this Country labours under such is the  Industry, Oconomy and good management of the Dutch that not only the necessarys  but all the luxuries of life are <sub>^</sub><sup>rais'd</sup>  here in as great abundance and <sub>^</sub><sup>are  sold</sup> as cheape if not cheaper then in any part of Europe some few articles  excepted- &nbsp;&nbsp;Naval Stores however do not want for <strike>in</strike>  Price any more here than they do at Batavia, these are only sold by the Company  who have a certain fix'd exorbitant price from which the[y] never deviate

        The Inhabitants of the Cape Town are in general well  bred and extremely civile and polite to all strangers, indeed it is their Intrest  so to do for the whole Town may be consider'd as one great Inn fited up for  the reception of all comers and goers &#151; Upon the whole there is perhaps  not a place in the known World that can equal this in affording refreshments  of all kinds to Shipping &#151; The Bay <sub>^</sub><sup>is</sup>  Capacious pretty safe and commodious, it lies open to the <small>NW</small>  winds, which winds we are told very Seldom blow strong, but some times sends  in a great sea for which reason Ships moor <small>NE</small>  and <small>SW</small> and in such a manner as to have an  open hawse with <small>NW</small> winds - the <small>SE</small>  winds blows frequently with great Volience but as this is right out of the Bay  it is attended, with no danger &nbsp;&nbsp;near the Town is a Warfe built of  Wood run out a proper distance into the Sea for the Conveniency of landing and  Shipping off goods &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to this warfe <strike>the</strike>  water is convey'd in pipes and by means of Cocks several boats may fill water  at one and the same time; the company keep several large strong Boats or Hoys,  to carry goods Provisions, Water &amp;C<sup>a</sup> to and  from Shipping as well strangers as their own. Fuel is one of the scarcest articles  <strike>in</strike> <strike>this</strike>  they have and is brought a long way out of the Country and consi[s]ts of Roots  of Trees Shrubs &amp;C<sup>a</sup> <strike>Indeed</strike>  <sub>^</sub><sup>except a few English  Oaks which they have planted</sup> this Country is wholy distitute of Wood,  except at too great a distance to be brought to the Cape. In the Article of  Timber Boa<sub>^</sub><sup>r</sup>ds  &amp;C<sup>a</sup> they are chiefly supply['d] from Batavia  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three of the Winter Months, / viz / from the Middle of May  to the Middle of August the Dutch <strike>oblige all their  ships to go</strike> do not allow any of their Ships to lay in Table Bay, but  oblige them to go into false Bay where there is a very safe harbour, and every  other conveniency both for their own shipping and strangers and where every  produce of the Country can be had as cheape as at the Cape Town. The Dutch I  am told never diveate from this custom of sending their Ships to False Bay at  this season of the Year notwithstand[ing] there has not a gale of wind happen'd  for many Years that would have put them in the least danger in Table Bay &#151;
        
        <p>
        
        Table Bay is defended by a Square <sub>^</sub><sup>Fort</sup>  situated on the East side of the Town close to the Sea beach together with several  other out works and Battries along the Shore of the Bay on each side of the  Town. they are so situated as to be Cannonaded by Shipping and are in a manner  defenceless againest a Superior land force &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Garrison at  present consists of 800 Regulars besides the Militia of the Country which comprehends  every man able to bear arms &#151;

        They can, by means of Signals, alarm the whole country  in a very short time and then every man is emmidiately to repair to the Cape  Town. The French at Mauritius are supply'd with large quantitys of Provisions  from the Cape / viz / Salted Beef, Biscuit, Flour and wine &nbsp;While we lay  in the Bay two store Ships belonging to the King of the burthen of 50 or 60  Gun Ships and a snow, sail'd for that Island Load[ed] with Provisions besides  a <sub>^</sub><sup>Large Kings</sup>  Frigate we left in the Bay takeing in her Cargo. The Provisions contracted for  by the French this year were Salt Beef 500,000 lb<sup>s</sup>  Flour 400,000 lb<sup>s</sup> Biscuit 400,000 lb<sup>s</sup>  and Wine 1200 Leagers
