        Monday 4<sup>th</sup> Winds at <small>SSE</small> and <small>SE</small> a gentle breeze and clear weather. In the <small>PM</small> steer'd thro' the passage which we found from 3 to 6 or 7 Miles broad and 8 or 9 Leagues in length <small>NBW<small>1/2</small>W</small> and <small>SBE<small>1/2</small>E</small>. It is form'd by the Main on the west and by Islands on the East one of which is at least 5 Leagues in length &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our depth of water in runing through was between 25 and 20 fathom every where good anchorage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;indeed the whole passage is one continued safe harbour, besides a number <sup>of</sup> small Bays and Coves on each side where <strike>^</strike><strike>to all appearances</strike> Ships might lay as it were in a Bason, at least so they appeard to me for I did not wait to examine them as having been in Port so lately and being unwilling to loose the benefit of a light Moon &nbsp;&nbsp;The land both on the Main and Islands especialy on the former is tolerable high and distinguished by hills and Vallies which are deversified with woods and Lawns that look'd green and pleasent - On a Sandy beach upon one of the Islands we saw two people and a Canoe with an outrigger that appeard to be both larger and differently built to any we have seen upon the Coast - At 6 oClock we were nearly the length of the north end of the passage the NWermost <sub>^</sub><sup>point</sup> of the Main in sight <sub>^</sub><sup>bore </sup><small>N</small>. 54&deg; West and the north end of the Islands <small>NNE</small> having an open sea between these two points&#135; <strike>w</strike>We kept under an easey Sail and the lead going all night having 21, 22 and 23 f<sup>m</sup> at the distance of 3 Leagues from the land - At day light in the Morning we were abreast of the point above mentioned which is a Lofty promontary that I named Ca<u>pe Gloucest</u>er / Latitude 19&deg;..57' S<sup>o</sup> Long<sup>de</sup> 211&deg;..54' W<sup>t</sup> / it may be known by an Island which lies out at Sea <small>NBW<small>1/2</small>W</small> 5 or 6 Leagues from it <sub>^</sub><sup>this I calld Holburn Isle</sup> - There are also Islands Laying under the Land between it and Whitsundays Passage, &nbsp;&nbsp;on the west side of the Cape the land trends away <small>SW</small> and <small>SSW</small> and forms a deep bay, the land in the bottom of this bay <strike>we</strike> <sup>I </sup>could but just see from the Mast head it is very low and is a Continuation of the same low land as is at the bottom of Repulse Bay &#151;&#151;&#151;&#151;&#151; <strike>w</strike>Without waiting to look into this Bay <sub>^</sub><sup>which I call'd <u>Edgcumbe Ba</u>y</sup> we continued our Course to the westward for the wester most land we had in sight which bore from us <small>WBN<small>1/2</small>N</small> and appeard very high - At Noon we were about 3 Leagues from the land and by observation in the Latitude of 19&deg;..47' S<sup>o</sup> Cape Gloucester &#151; bearing S 63&deg; East distant 7<small>1/2</small> Leagues &#151;

        [&#135;] This passage I have named Whitsunday's Passage, as it was discoverd on the day the Church commemorates that Festival and the Isles which form it Cumberland Isles &#151; in honour of His Royl Highness the Duke of Cumberland &#151;
