        Sunday 2<sup>nd.</sup> In the <small>PM</small> had it calm untill 2 oClock, when a light breeze sprung up at <small>NBE</small> and we stood in for the Land <small>EBN</small> untill 5 oClock, at which time we got the wind from the SW a light breeze with which we steer'd NE edgeing in for the land, having it in sight from the deck and which I judged to be about 3 or 4 Leagues off being all very low-Land. Found the Variation to be 2&deg;34' East and a little before 8 oClock having but little wind we Anchord in 7 fathom water a soft Muddy bottom. In the After-noon and Evening we saw several Sea Snakes some of which the People in the Boat along side took up by hand. At Day light in the Mor[n]ing we got under sail and Stood away to the NNE having a fresh gale at East, which by Noon brought us into the Latitude of 7&deg;14 S, Longd 222&deg;30' W. Depth of water 13 fathom. Course and distance sailed sence yesterday Noon is N 24&deg; East 27 miles, having at this time no land in sight for the land according to the Charts trends more Easterly than the wind would permit us to sail.
