        Wednesday 29<sup>th</sup> Continued standing to the northward with a fresh gale at <small>EBS</small>, and <small>SE</small> untill 6 oClock having Very errigular and uncertain soundings from 24 to 7 fathom - At 4 oClock we made the Land from the Mast head bearing <small>NWBN</small> and which appeard to be very low - at 6 it extended from <small>WNW</small> to <small>NNE</small> distant 4 or 5 Leagues, at this time hauld close upon awind to the Eastward untill 7 oClock than Tack'd and stood to the southward untill 12 at which time we wore and stood to the Northward untill 4 than lay her head off untill day-light when we again saw the land and stood in <small>NNW</small> directly for it haveing a fresh gale at <small>EBS</small>. Our Soundings in the night were from 17 to 5 fathom very erregular without any sort of rule with respect <strike>to the Land</strike> to our distance from the land - At <small>1/2</small> an hour past 6 oClock a small low Island laying about a League from the Main bore <small>NBW</small> distant 5 Miles, this Island lies in the Latitude of 8&deg;.13' S<sup>t</sup> Long<small>de</small> 221&deg;..25' West. I find it laid down in the Charts by the name of S<sup>t</sup> Bartholomeo or Wleermoysen. We now steer'd <small>NWBW</small>, <small>WNW</small>, <small>WBN</small>, <small>WBS</small> and <small>SWBW</small> as we found the land to lay, having a boat ahead of the Ship sounding depth of water from 5 to 9 fathom - when in 7, 8 and 9 fathom we could but just see the land from the deck, but I did not think we were at Most above 4 Leagues off because the land is exceeding low and level and appear'd to be well cover'd with wood, one sort appear'd to us to be Cocoa-nutt trees. By the Smooks we saw in different parts as we run along shore we were assured that the Country is in habited - At Noon we were about 3 Leagues from the land, the westermost part of which th<sub>^</sub><sup>a</sup>t we could see bore S<sup>t</sup> 79&deg; W<sup>t</sup>. &nbsp;&nbsp;our Latitude by observation was 8&deg;..19' S<sup>t</sup> Longitude 221&deg;..44' West. The Island S<sup>t</sup> Bartholmeo bore N<sup>t</sup> 74&deg; East distant 20 Mile &#151;
