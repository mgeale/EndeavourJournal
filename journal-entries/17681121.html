        Monday, 21<sup>st</sup> This Morning I received his Excellencys <strike>Answer</strike> Answer to my last Memorial and letter, in his letter he owns there was some indecency in detain[in]g the boat, but lays the blame to my Officer, who only executed the orders I gave him with spirit. In one part of his Memorial he says that from the built of the Ship and other circumstances he doubts that she is the Kings. This I thought proper to answer in writing by telling his Excellency that I was ready to produce my Commission. Rain the most part of this day.
