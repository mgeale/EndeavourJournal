        Fresh gales and clowdy the most part of these 24 hours.  PM got up the spare Mainsail to dry, it being wet by the Water geting into the  sail room, occasiond by the Ship being very leaky in her upper works. At 5 am  loosed 2 Reefs out of each topsail, and saw the land which we judged to be Cape  Finister and Cape Ortegal. At 10 Tacked being about 4 Miles off shore and stood  to the NW. Loosed all the reefs out and set topg<sup>t</sup> sails. At Noon, Cape Ortegal bore EBS distant about 8 Leagues.
