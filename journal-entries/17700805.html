        Sunday 5<sup>th</sup> In the <small>PM</small> had a gentle breeze at <small>SE</small> and clear weather, As I did not intend to weigh untill the Morning I sent all the boats to the reef to get what Turtle and shell fish they could. At Low-water from the Mast head I took a view of the shoals and could see several laying a long way without this one &nbsp;&nbsp;apart of several of them appearing above water, but as it appear'd pretty clear <sub>^</sub><sup>of Shoals</sup> <strike>away</strike> to the <small>NE</small> of the turtle reef, I came to a resolution to stretch out <sub>^</sub><sup>that way</sup> close upon a wind, because if we found no passage we could always return back the way we went. In the evening the boats returnd with one turtle a sting-ray and as many large Clams as came to one and a half <sub>^</sub><sup>pound</sup> a man, in each of these Clams were about two pounds of meat added to this we caught in the night several Sharks. Early in the morning I sent the Pinnace and Yawl again to the reef as I did not intend to wiegh untill half Ebb at which time the Shoals began to appear, before 8 oClock it came on to blow and I made the signal for the boats to come on board which they did and brought with them one turtle. We afterwards <strike>attempted</strike> <sup>began</sup> to heave, but the wind freshing obliged us to bear away again and lay fast &#151;
