        Saturday 2<strike>0</strike>1<sup>st</sup> Strong breezes at <small>SE</small> and Clowdy weather. In the <small>PM</small> sent a boat to haul the sain which return'd with as much fish as came to 1<small>3/4</small>lb a man. The yawl return'd with only one turtle which was caught in the nett for it blew too hard for the boat to strike any. In the morning I sent her out again but she was obliged to return not being able to get to windward - Carpenters employ'd <sub>^</sub><sup>in repairing</sup> <strike>overhauling</strike> the boats and overhauling the pumps and <sub>^</sub><sup>as</sup> the <sub>^</sub><sup>wind would not permit us to sail I sent the</sup> boatswain with some hands a shore makeing rope and a petty officer with two men to gather greens for the Ships company &#151;
