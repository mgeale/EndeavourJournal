Oberea, the Dolphins Queen, made us a Visit for the first time sence the Quadrant was Stolen, she introduce'd herself with a small Pigg for which she had a Hatchet, and as soon as she got it she lugg'd out a Broken Ax and several peices of Old Iron, these I believe she must have had from the Dolphin, the Ax she wanted to be mended and Axes made of the Old Iron. &nbsp;I obliged her in the first but excuse'd my self from the latter &nbsp;Sence the Natives <sub>^</sub> <sup>have</sup> <strike>a</strike> Seen the Forge at Work they have frequently brought pieces of Iron to be made into one sort of Tools or other, which hath generally been done when ever it did not hinder our own work, being willing to oblige them in every thing in my power; these pieces of Old Iron the natives must have got from the Dolphin, as we know of no other Ship being <sub>^</sub> <sup>here</sup> and very probably some from us; for there is <sub>^</sub> <sup>no</sup> species of theft they will not commit to get this Artic[l]e and I may say the same of the common seamen when in these parts &#151;
