        Tuesday 6<sup>th</sup> <small>PM</small> winds at South by East and South thick hazey weather untill 3 oClock when it cleared up and we saw the land extending from <small>NEBN</small> to <small>NW<small>1/2</small>N</small> and soon after, low land makeing like an Island bearing <small>W<small>1/2</small>S</small> &nbsp;&nbsp;keeping on our Course to the <small>WBS</small> we in two hours time saw high land over the low land extending to the southward as far as <small>SWBS</small>. We could not see this land join to that to the northward of us, there either being a total seperation, a deep bay or low land between them. At 8 oClock <strike>we was</strike> <sub>^</sub><sup>being</sup> within 3 Leagues of the low land / which we now took to be an Island / we tack'd and stood to the Eastward having the wind at south and which proved very unsettled all night &nbsp;&nbsp;by which means and a little bad management I found the Ship in the morning considerably farther to the eastward than I expected, and the wind afterwards coming to <small>SW</small> and <small>WSW</small> so that at noon we found our selves much about the same place as we were yesterday - our Latitude by observation being 46&deg;..50' S. The land extending from <small>NEBE</small> to <small>WBN</small> <small><small>1/2</small>N</small>, the nearest part bearing North distant 3 Leagues - the land to the <small>SW</small> just in sight &#151;
