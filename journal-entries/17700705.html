        Thursday 5<sup>th</sup> Strong breezes <sub>^</sub><sup>at <small>SE</small></sup> and fair weather. In the <small>PM</small> warped the ship over and at high-water laid her a shore on the sand bank on the south side of the <strike>Harbour</strike> River for I was afraid to lay her broad side to the shore where she lay before because the ground lies with too great a decent and she hath already received some damage by laying there these last neep tides, at least she still makes water &#151;
