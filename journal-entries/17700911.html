        Tuesday 11<sup>th</sup> Variable Light airs and clear weather. Steerd <small>NW</small> in order [to] discover the Land planer untill 4 oClock in the Morn-g at which time <sub>^</sub><sup>the</sup> wind came to <small>NW</small> and west with which we stood to the southward untill 9 oClock when we Tack'd and stood <small>NW</small> having the wind at <small>WSW </small>- At sun rise in the Morning we could see the land extend from <small>WNW</small> to <small>NE</small> - At Noon we could see it extend to the west-ward <sub>^</sub><sup>as far</sup> as <small>WBS<small>1/2</small>S</small>, but no further to the Eastward than <small>NBE</small>, we were <strike>yet </strike>now well assured that this was part of the Island of Timor. in concequence of which the last Island we saw must have been Timor land the south part of which lies in the Latitude of 8&deg;..15' S<sup>t</sup> Longitude 228&deg;..10' West, whereas in the Charts <sub>^</sub><sup>the South point</sup> <strike>at</strike> is laid down in Latitude 9&deg;..30'. &nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible that the Land we saw might be some other Island, but <sub>^</sub><sup>than</sup> I cannot See how we could have miss'd seeing Timor land supposeing it to be right laid down in Latitude as we never <strike>kept</strike> <sub>^</sub><sup>were</sup> to the Southward of 9&deg;..30', for my design was to have made that Island and to have Landed upon it to have seen what it produced at [<i>sic</i>] it is / according to the Charts / a large Island and not settled by the Dutch that I ever heard off &#151;

        We were now in the Latitude of 9&deg;.. 37' W<sup>t</sup> Longitude 233&deg;..54' W<sup>t</sup> by observation of the Sun and Moon, and yester[day] we were by Observation in 233&deg;..27' W<sup>t</sup> the difference is 27' which is exactly the same as what the Log gave. Thus however is a degree of accuracy in observation that is seldom to be expected &#151;
