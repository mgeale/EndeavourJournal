        First part Moderate and fair, the remainder frequent squalls attended with showers of rain. In the Course of this 24 hours we have had four Men died of the Flux, viz. Jn<sup>o</sup> Thompson Ships Cook, Benj. Jordan Carpenters Mate, James Nicholson and Arch<sup>d</sup> Wolfe Seamen. A Melancholy proff of the Calamitous <sub>^</sub><sup>Situation</sup> we are at present in, having hardly well men enough to tend the Sails and look after the Sick, many of the latter are so ill that we have not the least hopes of their recovery &#151;
