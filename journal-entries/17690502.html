        Tuesday, 2<sup>d</sup> This morning about 9 oClock when M<sup>r</sup> Green and I went to set up the Quad<sup>t</sup> it was not to be found, it had never been taken out of the Packing case / which was about 18 Inches square / sence it came from M<sup>r</sup> Bird the Maker; and the whole was pretty heavy, so that it was a matter of astonishment to us all how it could be taken away, as a Centinal stood the whole night within 5 Yards of the door of the Tent where it was put together with several other Instruments, but none of them was missing but this. However it was not long before we got information that one of the natives had taken it away and carried it to the Eastward- Immediatly a resolution was taken to detain all the Large Canoes that were in the Bay, and to seize upon Tootaha and some others of the Principle people and keep them in Custody untill the Quad<sup>t</sup> was produce'd &nbsp;&nbsp;but this last we did not think proper immidiatly to put in execution as we had only Obaria in our power and the detaining of her by force would have alarm'd all the rest. In the mean time M<sup>r</sup> Banks / who is always very alert upon all occations wherein the Natives are concern'd / and M<sup>r</sup> Green went into the Woods to enquire of <strike>Tabia Tomita</strike> Tooboura tomita which way and where the Quadrant was gone, &nbsp;&nbsp;I very soon was inform'd that these Three were gone to the Eastward in quest of it and some time after I follow'd my self with a small party of Men, but before I went away I gave orders that if Tootaha came either to the Ship or the Fort he was not to be detain'd for I found that he had no hand in takeing away <sub>^</sub> <sup>the</sup> Quadrant and that there was almost a certainty of geting it a gain. I met M<sup>r</sup> Banks and M<sup>r</sup> Green about 4 miles from the Fort returning with the Quadrant &nbsp;&nbsp;this was about Sun set and we all got back to the Fort about 8 oClock, where I found Toota ha in Custody and a Number of the Natives Crowding about the gate of the Fort. My going into the Woods with a party of arm'd men so alarm'd the Natives that in the evening they began to move off with their effects and a double Canoe puting off from the Bottom of the Bay was observ'd by the Ship and a boat sent after her; in this Canoe happen'd to be Tootaha and as soon as our boat came up with her, he and all the people that were in the Canoe jump'd over board, and he only was taken up and brought on board the Ship together with the Canoe, the rest were permited to swim ashore. From the Ship Tootaha was sent to the Fort, where M<sup>r</sup> Hicks thought proper to detain him untill I return'd- &nbsp;The Scene between <strike>Tabia tomita</strike> Toobouratomita and Toota ha, when the former came into the Fort and found the latter in custody, was realy moveing, they wept over each other for some time, as for Tootaha he was so far prepossess'd with the thought that he was to be kill'd that he could not be made sensible to the contrary till he was carried out of the Fort to the people, many of whom express'd their joy by embraceing him; and after all he would not go away untill he had given us two Hoggs, notwithstanding we did all in our power to hinder him, for it is very certain that the treatment he had met with from us did not merit such a reward. however we had it in our power to make him a present of equal Value when ever we pleased &#151;

        We had now time to <strike>enquire</strike> <sup>consider</sup> how the quadrant was Stoln. &nbsp;It is very probable that the man who took it had seen the box brought into the Tent or else had been well inform'd by others and had from that moment resolved to steal it, for about sunset last night a man was seen crawling a long the bank of the River behind the Fort, but on being spoken to he went away.&nbsp;&nbsp; however it is very clear that he was watching for an opportunity to get into the Fort in the dusk of the evening before the centinals were call'd in and while the most of our people, after leaving of work, were diverting themselves with the natives. &nbsp;however my self and some others were never out of the Fort and I did not stir out of the Tent where the quad<sup>t</sup> was till Sun set, then walk'd several times round the Inside of the Fort after which I went into M<sup>r</sup> Banks's Markee and order'd the Drumer to beat the tattoo &nbsp;in the doing of which he went 3 times round the works yet in one of these Short intervals when either mine or the drumers back turn'd the man found means to carry off the Box for immidiately <strike>after</strike> <sub>^</sub> <sup>upon </sup>beating the Tattoo every boddy came into the Fort, the centinals call'd and place'd in the inside when it wold have been impossible for him to have done it. Indeed we found it difficult to beleive that a naked Indian, frighten'd of f[i]rearms as they are, would have made such an attemp'd at the certain risk of his life
