        Saturday 27<sup>th</sup> Fresh gales Westerly &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This day we got the Tiller properly secure'd which hath been the employment of the Armourers and part of the Carpenters sence we anchor'd at this place, the former in repairing and making new Iron work and the latter in fixing a Transom for the want of which the Tiller has often been in danger of being broke, the Iron braces that supply'd the want of a transom have broke every time they have been repair'd. Coopers still imploy'd repairing the Casks, some hands with the Long-boat geting on board Stones to put into the bottom of the bread <sub>^</sub><sup>room</sup> to bring the Ship more by the stern while others were employ'd cuting wood, repairing the rigging and fishing &#151;
