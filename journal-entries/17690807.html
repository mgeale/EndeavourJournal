        Monday 7<sup>th</sup> Variable light airs <small>PM</small> some showers of rain - Being desireous to see King Opoony we made a party this after noon and went ashore for that purpose, carrying along with us a small present: <sub>^</sub><sup>upon our landed</sup> he did not receive us siting as all the other cheifs had hitherto done or in any manner of form; this we attributed to his stupitity for such he appear'd to be. &nbsp;&nbsp;however he gave me a Hog in return for the present I made him and this was paying us full as great a Compliment, before we took our leave we let him know that we should go to Otaha in the morning in our Boats and would be glad to have him along with us, and he accordingly promise'd to accompany us thither. Accordingly very early in the Morning I set out with both Pinnace and Long boat for Otaha and some of the gentlemen along with me and in our way called upon Opoony who was in his Canoe ready to set out <strike>along with us</strike>: as soon as we landed on Otaha I made him a present of a Ax, this I thought would induce <sub>^</sub><sup>him</sup> to incourage his subjects to bring us such provisions as we wanted, but I belive we had already got all they intended us &nbsp;for after staying with him untill noon we <strike>was</strike> were obliged to go away without geting any one thing &#151;
