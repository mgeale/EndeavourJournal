        Saturday 30<sup>th</sup> Moderate breezes at SE and clear serene weather. In the PM the Boat returnd from hauling the sain having caught as many fish as came to a pound and a half a man. In the AM I sent her again to haul the Sain and some hands to gather greens while others were employ'd about the rigging, &amp;Ca &amp;Ca &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I likewise sent some of the young gentlemen to take a Plan of the harbour and went my self upon the hill which is over the south point to take a view of the Sea - at this time it was low-water and I saw what gave me no small uneasiness which were a Number of Sand banks or shoals laying all along the coast, the innermost lay <sup>about 3 or 4</sup> <strike>hardly a</strike> Mile<sup>s</sup> from the Shore and the outermost extend off to sea as far as I could see with my glass. some just appeard above water - The only hopes I have of getting clear of them is to the northward where there seems to be <sub>^</sub><sup>a</sup> passage for as the winds blowe<strike>s</strike> constantly from the <small>SE</small> we shall find it difficult if not impractical, to return <sub>^</sub><sup>back</sup> to the southward <strike>besides the shoals to the Southward lay so near this shore that it is a wonder to me how we escaped them in coming here &#151;</strike>
