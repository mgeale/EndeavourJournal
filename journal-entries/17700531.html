        Thursday, 31st. Winds southerly and <sup>SE</sup> dark hazey weather with rain in the <sup>PM</sup>. finding no one inducement to stay longer in this place we at 6 in the <sup>AM</sup> weighd and put to Sea and stood to the <sup>NW</sup> having the advantage of a fresh breeze at S<sup>SE</sup>. We kept without the Group of Islands which lay in shore &amp; to the <sup>NW</sup> of Thirsty Sound, as there appear'd to be no safe passage between them and the Main; at the same time we had a number of Islands without us extending out to sea as far as we could see. As we run in this diretion our depth of water was 10, 8 and 9 fathom. At Noon the <sup>NW</sup> point of Thirsty Sound which I have named Pier head bore S 36&deg; E distant 5 Leagues, the East point of the other inlet, which communicates with the former as I have before mention, bore South by west distant 2<small>1/2</small> Leagues, the groupe of Islands above mentioned laying between us and the point; the farthest part of the Main in sight on the other side of the Inlet bore <sup>NW</sup>. Our Latitude by Observation was 21&deg; 53'.
