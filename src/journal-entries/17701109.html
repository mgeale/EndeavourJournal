        Friday 9<sup>th</sup> In the <small>PM</small> Hove the Larboard side of the Ship Keel out and found her bottom to be in a far worse condition than we expected, the False Keel was gone to within <strike>to within</strike> 20 feet of the stern post, the Main Keel wounded in ma[n]y places very considerably, a great quantity of Sheathing [off], several planks much damaged especially under the Main channell near the Keel were two planks and a half near 6 feet in length were within <small>1/8</small> of a Inch of being cut through and here the worms had made their way quite into the Timbers, so that it was a Matter of Surprise to every one who saw her bottom how we had kept her above water and yet in this condition we had saild some hundreds of Leagues in as dangerous a Navigation as is in any part of the world happy in being ignorant of the continual danger we were in. In the Evening righted the Ship &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having only time to patch up some of the worst places to prevent the water geting in in large quantitys for the present &#151;

        In the Morning hove her down again and most of the Carpenters, and Caulkers in the yard / which are not a few / were set to work upon her bottom and at the same time a number of slaves were employ'd bailing the water out of the hold, our people altho they attend were seldom called upon, indeed by this time we were so weake[n]d by sickness that we could not muster above <sup><strike>3</strike>20</sup> Men and officers that were able to do duty so little should we have been able to have hove her down and repair'd her our selves as I at one time thought us capable of &#151;
