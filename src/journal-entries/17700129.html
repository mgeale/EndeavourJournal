        Monday 29<sup>th</sup> Winds as yesterday. <small>PM</small> rainy weather the remainder fair and Clowdy Pretty early in the <small>AM</small> an old man who had made us several Visits upon our first arival here, came on board and told us that one of our boats had fire'd upon and wounded two of their people one of which was dead of his wounds &nbsp;&nbsp;this affair happen'd on Sunday was a week and never before now came to my Knowlidge. On that day the Master and five Petty officers desired to have a small boat to go a fishing, but instead of keeping within the Usual boands and under the protection of the Ship they went over to the Hippa on the Island from which some of the inhabitents put off in two Canoes, as they thought to attack them, this caused the Master to fire and according to the report of the old man wounded two <strike>of</strike> one of which is sence dead: but this last circumstance was soon after contradicted by another of the natives who M<sup>r</sup> Green and Tupia saw a Shore, and I wish this last report may be true <sup><strike>^</strike>/ <sub></sub><strike>which I very much doubt</strike> /</sup> because I find the reasons for fireing upon them are not very justifiable &#151;
        
        <p>
        
        This morning I went out to the mouth of the Inlet and landed upon the West point and from the top of a pretty high hill which is there I had a view of the Coast to the <small>NW</small>, the farthest land I could see in that quarter was an Island about 10 Leagues off and lying pretty near the main <sub>^</sub><sup>and is the same as hath been before mentiond</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;between this Island and the place where I was lay some other Islands close under the Shore which forms several Bays, wherein there appears to be safe anchorage for Shipping - <strike>one of these Bays I take to be murders Bay descover'd by Tasman &#151;</strike>
        
        <p>
        
        After I had set the different points &amp;Ca we errected upon the Top of the Hill a tower or pile of stones in which we left a peice of Silver Coin, some Musquet Balls, Beeds &amp;C<sup>a</sup> and left flying upon it a peice of an old pendant: after this we return'd to the boat and in our way to the Ship visited some of the natives we <strike>had</strike> met with a long shore and purchas'd of them a small quantity of fish &#151;
