        Wednesday 1<sup>st</sup> Strong gales from the <small>SE</small> with Squals attended with rain. In the <small>PM</small> the Yawl came in with two rays which together weigh'd 265 lb &nbsp;&nbsp;it blowed too hard all the time they were out for strikeing turtle. Carpenters employ'd overhauling the Pumps all of which we find in a state of decay and this the Carpenter says is owing to the sap having been left on which in time has decay'd the sound wood. one of them is quite useless and was so rotten when hoisted up as to drop to pieces, however I cannot complain of a leaky ship for the most water she makes is not quite an Inch an hour &#151;
