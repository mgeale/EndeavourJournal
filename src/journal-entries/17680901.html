        Very hard gales, with some heavy showers of Rain, the  most part of these 24 hours, which brought us under our two courses, broke one  of our Main topmast Puttock Plates, Washed overboard a small boat belonging  to the Boatswain and drowned between 3 and 4 Doz<sup>n  </sup>of our Poultry which was worst of all, towards Noon it moderated so that  we could bear our Main topsail close Reef'd. At Midnight Wore and stood to the  Southward.
