        Tuesday 19<sup>th</sup> The Wind still continues at West. <small>PM</small> a moderate breeze and clear weather &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 7 Tacked in 35 fathom water, the point of land before mentioned bore <small>NWBN</small> distant 4 or 5 miles, having not gained one Inch to windward this last 24 hours which is a great proof that there must be a Current seting to the Eastward. The Point of land above mentioned I have call'd North Cape judgeing it to be the northern most extremity of this Country &#151; it lies in the Latitude of 34&deg;..22' S<sup>o</sup> and Long<sup>d</sup> 186&deg;..55' West from Greenwich <sub>^</sub><sup>and N 63&deg;: West 31 Leagues from C. Brett</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;It <sub>^</sub><sup>forms the north point of Sandy Bay and</sup> is a Peninsula juting out <small>NE</small> about 2 Miles and terminates in a bluff head which is flat at top; the Isthmus which joins this head to the Main land is very low on which account the land of the Cape from several situations make like an Island. It appears still more remarkable when to the southward of it by <sub>^</sub><sup>the appearence of </sup>a high round Island at the <small>SE</small> point of the Cape. &nbsp;&nbsp;but this is likewise a deception being a round hill join'd to the Cape by a low narrow neck of land. On the <small>SE</small> side of the Cape is a <strike>Bay wherein</strike> there appears to be Anchorage, and where ships must be coverd from <small>S.W.</small> and <small>N.W.</small> winds. We saw a Heppa or Village upon the Cape and some few inhabitants. In the night had some squalls attended with rain which obliged us to take a nother reef in our topsails. At 8 <small>AM</small> tack'd and stood in shore and being moderate loos'd a reef out of each topsail and set the small sails. At Noon <strike>was</strike> <sup>we were</sup> in the Latitude of 34&deg;.. 2' S<sup>o</sup> and being hazey over the land we did not see it &#151;
