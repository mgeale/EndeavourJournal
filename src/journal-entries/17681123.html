        Wednesday, 23<sup>rd</sup> Fine pleasent weather. Emp<sup>d</sup> as before and setting <strike>up</strike> up the rigging. This day I received from the Viceroy an Answer to my last Memorial wherein he still keeps up his doubts that she is not a Kings Ship, and accuseth my people <strike>doth</strike> of Smugling a thing I am very certain they were not guilty of, and for which his Excellency could produce no proff, notwithstanding ma<sub>^</sub><sup>n</sup>y artfull means were made use of to tempt such of our people as were admitted ashore to trade by the Very Officers that were under his Excellencys own roof. I thought it incumbant on me to answer this Memorial, in which I desired his Excellency to take into custody any one of my people that should be found trading even if it amounted to no more then one of the sailors seling his Cloths from of his Back for a Bottle of Rum, for what his Excellency <strike>found</strike> call'd smugling I was very certain amounted to no more, and even this was only suspicions of my own.
