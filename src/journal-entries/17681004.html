        Calm for the greatest part of   these 24 hours. By an Observation we had this Morning of the Sun and Moon, found   our selves in the Long<sup>d</sup> of 22&deg; 32' 30" West   from Greenwich that by account is 21&deg; 58', the difference being 34 Miles Westerly,   which doth not agree with the Seting of the current for having try'd it twice   to day and found it set to the ESE 1 Mile per hour, and at the same time found   the Ship to the Southward of the Log by the Noon observation 10 miles. Served   Portable soup and Sour Krout to the Ship's Compney.
