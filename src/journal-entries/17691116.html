        Note, In speaking of Mercury Bay I had forgot to mention that the Mangrove trees found there produce a resinous substance very much like rosin - something of this kind I am told is found in both the East and West Indias. We found it at first in small lumps upon the Sea beach, but afterwards found it sticking to the Mangrove trees and by that means found out from whence it came &#151;
