        Friday 11<sup>th</sup> Winds southerly in the day and in the night Westerly a gentle breeze and clear weather. At 4 <sup>PM</sup> past at the distance of 1 Mile a low rocky point which I named <sup>Point <sub>^</sub>Stephens</sup> / Lat<sup>de</sup> 32&deg; 45 <strike>a little to</strike> <sub>^</sub><sup>on</sup> the north<strike>ward</strike> <sub>^</sub><sup>side</sup> of this point is an inlet which I calld Port Stephens <sub>^</sub><sup>/ Lat. 32&deg; 40, Log<sup>de</sup> 207&deg; 51' / </sup>that appear'd to me from the mast head to be shelterd from all winds, <strike>before</strike> <sup>at</sup> the entrance lay 3 small Islands two of which are of a tolerable height and on the Main near the shore are some high round hills that make at a distance like Islands, in passing this bay at the distance of 2 or 3 miles from the shore our soundings were from 33 to 27 fathoms from which I conjector'd that there must be a sufficient depth of water <sub>^</sub><sup>for shipping</sup> in the Bay. We saw several smooks alittle way in the Country <strike>upon</strike> <sub>^</sub><sup>rise up from</sup> the flat land &nbsp;by this I did suppose that there were Lagoons which afforded subsistance for the natives such as shell fish &amp;C<sup>a</sup> for we as yet know nothing else they live upon &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At <small>1/2</small> past 5 the Northermost land in sight bore N. 36&deg; E<sup>t</sup> and <strike>Point</strike> <sub>^</sub><sup>Point Stephens</sup> <strike>Kepple</strike> South-west distant 4 Leagues &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at this time we took in our studding sails and run under an easey sail all night untill 4 oClock <sup>AM</sup> when we made all sail - our soundings in the night was from 48 to 62 fathom at the distance of between 3 and 4 Leagues from the land - At 8 oClock we were abreast of a high point of land which made in two hillocks - this point I called <u>Cape Hawke</u> Lat<sup>de</sup> 32&deg;..14' S<sup>o</sup> Long<sup>de</sup> 207&deg;..30 West; it bore from us at this time west dist<sup>t</sup> 8 Miles and the same time the northermost land in sight bore N 6&deg; East and appear'd high and like an Island - at Noon this land bore N. 8&deg; East the northermost land in sight N. 13&deg; East and C<u>ape Morton</u> <sup>H<u>aw</u>ke</sup> S<sup>o</sup> 37&deg; West - Lat<sup>de</sup> in p<sup>r</sup> Observation 32&deg;..2' S<sup>o</sup> which was 12 Miles to the southward of that given by the Logg - which I do suppose to be owing to a current setting that way.
