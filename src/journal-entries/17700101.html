        Monday, 1<sup>st</sup> Jan<sup>ry</sup> 1770. <small>PM</small> fresh breeze <strike>and</strike> at <small>SWBS</small> and squally, the remainder moderate breezes at <small>SWBS</small> and <small>SW</small> clear weather. At 7 <small>PM</small> Tack'd and Stood to the Westward, <strike>the high land over the West point of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which lies on the Eastern side of the coast</strike> <sup>At this time Mount Camel</sup> bore <small>N</small>. 83&deg; East and the northermost land or Cape Maria Van Diemen <small>NBW</small>, being distant from the nearest shore 3 Leagues; in this situation had 40 fathom water. Note, <strike>the high land above mentioned</strike> <sup>Mount Camel</sup> doth not appear to lay little more than a Mile from the sea on this side and about the same distance on the other, so that the land here cannot be above 2 or 3 Miles broad from sea to sea, which is what I conjecter'd when we w<strike>as</strike>ere <sub>^</sub><sup>in Sandy bay</sup> on the other side of the coast. &#151; At 6 <small>AM</small> tack'd and Stood to the Eastward the Island of the Three Kings <small>NWBN</small> - At Noon tack'd again and stood to the westward being in the latitude of 34&deg;..37' S<sup>o</sup> The Island of the 3 Kings bore <small>NWBN</small> distant 10 or 11 Leagues <strike>and a point of land &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leagues to the westward of the north Cape bore</strike> <sup>and Cape Maria Vandiemen</sup> N. 31&deg; E<sup>t</sup> distant 4<small>1/2</small> Leagues, in this situation had 54 fathom water. <sub>^</sub><sup>I cannot help thinking but what</sup> <strike>It</strike> will appear a little strange that at this season of the year we should be three weeks in getting 10 Leagues to the westward and five weeks in geting 50 Leagues <sub>^</sub><sup>for so long it is sence we pass'd C. Brett - </sup> but it will hardly be credited that in the midest of summer and in the Latitude of 35&deg; such a gale of wind as we have had could have happen'd, which for its strength and continuence was such as I hardly was ever in before -  Fortunately at this time we were a good distance from land otherwise it would have proved fatal to us &#151;
