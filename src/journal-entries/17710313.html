        WEDNESDAY 13th. In the PM having the Wind at South we steerd a long shore WBS<small>1/2</small>S until 3 oClock, when finding this Course carried us off from the land we Steerd WBN. At 6 oClock Cape Laguillas or the high land over it bore EBN Distant 12 Leagues and the Westermost land in sight NW<small>1/2</small>W. We continued a WBN Course with the wind at SE untill day light in the Morning, when we hauld in NW and NWBN, At 8 the Cape of Good hope NWBN and at 10 we were abreast of it, and distant off about 1 League or little more. We pass'd close without a rock on which the Sea brok[e] very high, it lies about a League right out to sea from the Cape. After passing the Cape we keept along shore at the distance of about one League off having a fresh gale at SE. At Noon the Cape bore SE distant 4 L[eagues].
