        Tuesday 5<sup>th</sup> <small>PM</small> had the winds at <small>SW</small> and <small>WSW</small> a fresh breeze. At 3 oClock we returnd on board and after dinner viseted a nother part of the Bay, but met with nothing new: by the evening all our empty Casks were fill'd with water and had at the same time got on board a large quantity of Sellery which is found here in great plenty. &nbsp;&nbsp;this I still continue to be boild every morning with Oatmeal and Portable Soup for the ships companies breakfast - At 4 <small>AM</small> weigh'd with a light breeze at <small>SE</small>, but had Variable light airs and sometimes calm untill near noon when a gentle breeze sprung up at North - at this time we had not got out of the Bay. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our Latitude by observation was 35&deg;..9' S<sup>t</sup> This Bay I have before observed, lies on the West side of Cape <u>Brett</u>. I have named it the <u>Bay of Islands</u> on account of the great number which line its shores and these help to <sub>^</sub><sup>form</sup> several safe and Commodious harbours where in is room and depth of water sufficient for any number of Shipping. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the one we lay in is on the <small>SW</small> side of the South westermost Island that lies on the <small>SE</small> side of the Bay. I have made no accurate survey of this Bay &nbsp;&nbsp;the time it would have required to have done this discouraged me from attempting of it &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;besides I thought it quite sufficient to be able to affirm with certainty that it affords good anchorage, and every kind of refreshments for Shipping; but as this was not the season for roots, we got only fish some few we caught our selves with hook and line and in the Saine but by far<strike>r</strike> the greatest part we purchass'd of the Natives and these of Various sorts, such as Shirks, sting-rays, Breams, Mullet, Mackarel and several other sorts; their way of catching of them <strike>is</strike> are the same as ours, / viz / with hooks and lines and with saines, of these last they have some prodigious large made all of a Strong kind of grass. The Mackarel are in every respect the same as those we have in England only some of them are larger than any I ever saw in any other part of the world; altho this is the season for this fish we have never been able to catch one with hook and line &#151;

        The Inhabitants of this Bay are far more numerous than <sub>^</sub><sup>at</sup> any other place we have yet been in and seem to live in friendship one with a nother altho it doth not att all appear that they are united under one head. they inhabited both the Islands and the main and have a number of Heppa's or strong holds, and these are all built upon such place as nature hath in a great part fortified and what she hath left undone the people themselves have finished &#151;

        It is high-water in this Bay at full and Change of the Moon about 8 oClock and the tide at these times rises and falls upon a perpendicular, 6 or 8 feet. It appears from the few observations I have been able to make of the tides on the Sea Coast, that the flood comes from the southward; and I have lately had reasons to think that there is a Current which comes from the westward and sets along shore to the <small>SE</small> <sup><sub>^</sub>or <small>SSE</small></sup> as the Land lays
