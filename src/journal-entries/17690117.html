        Thursday [Tuesday] 17<sup>th</sup> Jan<sup>ry</sup>  Fresh gales at South, <small>SW</small> and <small>W</small>,  with rain and Snow and of Course very cold weather, notwithstanding we kept  geting on board Wood and water, and finished the Survey of the Bay. M<sup>r</sup>  Banks and his Party not returning this Evening as I expected gave me great uneasiness  as they were not prepared for staying out the night, however, about noon they  returned in no very comfortable condition and what was still worse two black  servants to M<sup>r</sup> Banks had perished in the night  with cold; great part of the day they landed was spent before they got through  the woods, after which they advanced so far into the Country that they were  so far from being able to return that night that it was with much difficulty  they got to a place of tolerable shelter where they could make a fire &#151;  these two men being intrusted with great part of the Liquor that was for the  whole party had made too free with it and stupified themselves to that degree  that they either could or would not travel but laid themselves down in a place  where there was not the least thing to shelter them from the inclemency of the  night. This was about a <small>1/4</small> of a Mile from where the rest took up their  quarters and notwithstanding their repeated endeavours they could not get them  to move one step farther, and the bad traveling made it impossible for any one  to carry them, so that they were oblig'd to leave them and the next morning  they were both found dead &#151;
