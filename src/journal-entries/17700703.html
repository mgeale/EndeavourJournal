        Tuesday 3<sup>rd</sup> Winds at <small>SE</small>. fore and middle parts a <strike>fresh</strike> gentle breeze the remainder a fresh gale. In the evening the fishing party returnd having got as much fish as came <sub>^</sub><sup>to</sup> 2 lb a man; at High-water Attempted to heave the Ship off but did not succeed - At Noon the Master returnd and reported that he had found a passage out to sea between the shoals which passage lies out <small>ENE</small> or <small>EBN</small> from the <strike>harbours</strike> <sup>Rivers</sup> mouth - he found these shoals to consist of Coral rocks, he landed upon one which drys at low-water where he found very large cockles and a variety of other shell fish a quantity of which he brought away with him. He told me that he was 5 Leagues out at Sea having at that distance of 21 fathom water and judged him self to be without all the shoals which I very much doubted, after this he came in shore and and stood to the northward where he met with a number of shoals laying a little distant from the shore - about 9 oClock in the evening he landed in a bay about 3 Leagues to the northward of this place where he disturbed some of the natives whome he supposed to be at supper; they all fled upon his approach and left him some fresh Sea Eggs and a fire ready lighted behind them but there was neither house nor hut near &#151; Altho these Shoals lay with<sub>^</sub><sup>in</sup> sight of the coast and abound very much with shell fish <sub>^</sub><sup>and other small fish</sup> which are to be caught at low-water in holes in the rocks - yet the natives never visit them for if they did we must have seen of these large shells on shore about their fire places, the reson I do suppose is, <strike>for fish that pa</strike> that they have no boats that they dare venture <sub>^</sub><sup>so far</sup> out at Sea in &#151;
