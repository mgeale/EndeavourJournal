        Tuesday 26<sup>th</sup> Moderate breezes Easterly and hazey weather. Standing to the southward close upon a wind at Noon was in the Lat<sup>d</sup> of 35&deg;..10' S<sup>o</sup> and Long<sup>d</sup> 188&deg;..20' W<sup>t</sup>. The Island of the Three Kings <small>N</small>. 26&deg; West dist<sup>t</sup> 22 Leag<sup>e</sup>. In this situation had no land in sight and yet by observation we are in the Latitude of the Bay of Islands and by my reckoning but 30 Leagues to the westward of the North Cape from whence it appears that the northern part of this Land must be very narrow otherwise we must have seen some part of the west side of it &#151;
