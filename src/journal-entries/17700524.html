        Thursday 24<sup>th</sup> In the <sup>PM</sup> I was emp<sup>d</sup> a Shore in the transactions before related. At 4 in the <sup>AM</sup> we weighd with a gentle breezes and South and made sail out of the Bay <strike>which I call'd &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the north point <sub>^</sub> of which I call'd &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the South point &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the distance from the one to the other is <small>NW<small>1/2</small>N</small> and <small>SE<small>1/2</small>S</small> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miles</strike>.
