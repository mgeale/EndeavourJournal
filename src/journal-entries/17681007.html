        Variable Light Airs and calm   all this 24 hours. At Noon found the current to set <small>SE</small><small>1/4</small><small>S</small>   one Mile an hour, and yet by Observation at Noon I find the Ship 12 Miles to   the Northward of account, a circumstance that hath not happen'd for many days   and which I believe to be owing to the heavy squalls we had yesterday from the   <small>SE</small>, which obliged us to put frequently before   the Wind.
