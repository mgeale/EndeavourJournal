        Thursday, 17<sup>th</sup> Set some people to repair the sails and the Caulkers to caulk the ship, the rest of the people emp<sup>d</sup> in the hold and about the Rigging. For these three days past I have remonstrated to the Viceroy and his officers againest his putting a guard into my Boat, thinking I could not answer it to the Admiralty the tamely submitting to such a custom which, when practised in its full force must bring disgrace to the Brittish Flag, on the other hand I was very loath to enter into disputes seeing how much I was like to be delay'd and imbarrassed in geting the supplys I wanted, for it was with much difficulty that I obtain'd leave for one of my people to attend the Market to buy necessaries for my Table and to Assist the Agent to buy the things for the Ship; having gain'd this point and settled every thing with the Agent in regard to what was wanting for the Ship: I resolved rather than be made a prisoner in my own Boat not to go any more a shore unless I could do it without having a Soldier put into the Boat, as had hitherto been done, and thinking that the Vice roy might lay under some Mistake which on proper Application might be cleared up: I therefore drew up a Memorial, stating the whole case and sent to the Viceroy this afternoon, and thus a paper war commence'd between me and his Excellency, wherein I had no other advantage than the racking his invention to find reasons for treating us in the manner he did, for he never would relax the least from any one point.
