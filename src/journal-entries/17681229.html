        First part Moderate breeze and Clowdy, remainder a fresh breeze  and clear, <small>PM</small> loosed all the Reefs out and  got topg<sup>t</sup> yards aCross, Variation p<sup>r</sup>  Az<sup>th</sup> 16°..12'; p<sup>r</sup>  amp<sup>d</sup> 16°.. 32', mean of the two 16°.. 22' East  - between 9 and 10 <small>AM</small> took Seven sets of  Observations between the Sun and Moon to find the Longitude of the Ship, each  set consisting of three observations, the Mean of the Whole gave 59°.. 18'..  34" West of Greenwich; the result of each set was as follows / Viz / 1<sup>st</sup>  set - 59°.. 8', 2<sup>nd</sup> 59°.. 21': 3<sup>rd</sup>  59°..34'; 4<sup>th</sup> 59°..17'; 5<sup>th</sup>  59°.. 11'.. 45"; 6<sup>th</sup> 59°.. 19'.. 30" and the  7<sup>th</sup> 59°.. 20'.. 45" - the greatest difference  between any two, /viz / between the 1<sup>st</sup> and  3<sup>rd</sup> is but 26'. and the mean of these two differs  from the mean of the whole only 2'..26": this shew<sup>s</sup>  to what degree of accuracy these observations can be made, even by different  Persons. for 4 of these were made and computed by M<sup>r</sup>  Green and the rest by myself: the Long<sup>d</sup> given  by the Ship reckoning from the last observations five days ago differs only  eight miles from the Observ<sup>ns</sup> which shews that  we have not been in any currents &#151; Soundings from 40 to 47 f<sup>m</sup>
