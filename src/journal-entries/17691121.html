        Tuesday 21<sup>st</sup> After land as above-mentioned we had not gone a hundred yards into the Woods before we found a tree that girted 19 feet 8 Inches, 6 feet above the Ground, and having a quadrant with me I found its length from the root to the first branch to be 89 feet.&nbsp;&nbsp; it was as streight as an arrow and taper'd but very little in proportion to its length.&nbsp; so that <sub>^</sub><sup>I</sup> judged that there was 356 solid feet of timber in this tree clear of the branches. We saw many others of the same sort several of which <strike>was half as long again</strike> <sup>were taller than</sup> the one we measured and all of them very stout; there were likewise many other sorts of very stout timber trees all of them wholy unknown to any of us &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we brought away a few specimans and at 3 oClock we embarqued in order to return on bioard with the very first of the Ebb <sub>^ </sub><sup>but not before we had named this River the Thames on account of its bearing some resemblence to that River in england.</sup> In our return down the River the inhabitants of the Village where we landed <sub>^</sub><sup>in</sup> going, seeing that we return'd by a nother Channell put off in their Canoes and met us and trafficked with us in the most friendly manner immaginable untill they had disposed of the few trifles they had -

        The Tide of Ebb just carried us out of the <sub>^</sub><sup>narrow part of the</sup> River into the <strike>Bay</strike> <sup>Sea reach as I may call it</sup> . where meeting with the flood and a strong breeze at <small>NNW</small> obliged us to come to a grappling and we did not reach the Ship untill 7 oClock <sub>^</sub><sup>in the</sup> AM &#151;

        Intending to get under Sail at high water the Long boat was sent to take up the Kidge anchor but <sub>^</sub><sup>it blow'd so strong that she</sup> could not reach the B<sub>^</sub><sup>u</sup>oy and <strike>it begining to blow strong was</strike> <sup>the gale increasing soon</sup> <sub>^</sub> obliged us to bear away more Cable and strike Topgallant yards &#151;
