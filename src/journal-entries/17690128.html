        Fresh gales the most part  of this day, first and middle parts Clowdy. Latter Clear with a sharp cold air-  &nbsp;&nbsp;at 2PM saw <strike>the</strike> Land bearing North  Distant about 8 Leagues, it made in 2 hum<sub>^</sub><sup>m</sup>ocks  and appeared to be an Island, which I take to be the Isle of Diego Ramirez.&nbsp;&nbsp;  it lays in the Latitude of 56&deg;..38' South and Long<sup>d</sup>  68&deg;.47' West from Greenwich; found the Variation this Evening to be 22&deg;  East. <small>AM</small> had 3 sets of Observation of the  Sun and Moon, which gave the Longitude 69&deg;..7'..15" <small>W</small>.  The Long<sup>d</sup> of the Ship at Noon by the Obser<sup>n</sup>  is 69&deg;..24' &#151; 1&deg; 48'&nbsp;&nbsp; the Long<sup>d</sup>  made from Cape Horn is = 67&deg;..36' &nbsp;&nbsp;the Long<sup>d</sup>  of the Cape which is 52' less than the result of yesterdays observations. This  difference may arise part[l]y from the observations and partly from the Ships  Run; the Mean of the 2 gives 68&deg; 2' + 68&deg;..24', the Longitude of the  Cape from the observations taken at Strait Le Maire = 136.26' <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>   <td><u>136..26</u></td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td>&nbsp;x&nbsp;2    = 68&deg;..13'  West from Greenwich, the Longd of Cape Horn, being deduced  from no less than 24 observations, taken at no very great distance from  the Cape and on both sides of it, and when the Sun was both to the East and  West of the Moon, for in this case the errors ariseing from observation are  most likely to correct one a nother &#151;</td>  </tr> </table>
