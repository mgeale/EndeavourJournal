About one oClock  in the <small>PM</small> departed this life Lieut<sup>t</sup>  Hicks and in the evening his body was commited to the Sea with the usual ceremonies,  he died of a Consumption which he was not free from when we saild from England  so that it may be truly said that he hath been dieing ever sence, tho he held  out tollerable well untill we got to Batavia &#151;
