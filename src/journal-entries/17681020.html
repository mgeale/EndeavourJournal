        Gentle gale and clear weather.   At a little before 5 <small>PM</small> had an observation   of the Sun and Moon which gave the Long<sup>d</sup> 25&deg;   46' West from Greenw<sup>ch</sup> which is more westerly   than that by account carried on from the last observations, and the observed   Lat<sup>d</sup> being again to the northward of account   shews that there must be a current seting between the N<sup>th</sup>   and West.
