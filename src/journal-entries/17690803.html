        Thursday 3<sup>rd</sup> Winds  from <small>ESE</small> to <small>NE</small>  Very hot weather. This after noon I went ashore to look for a place to get Stones  for Ballast and a watering place, both of which I found very convenient and  in the morning sent an Officer a shore to superintend the get<sub>^</sub><sup>ting</sup>  off Ballast and water and I went in the Pinnace to the <strike>Eastward</strike>  <sub>^</sub><sup>Northward</sup> to  survey that part of the Island, accompined by M<sup>r</sup>  Banks and D<sup>r</sup> Solander, while the Carpenters  were Employd on board stoping the leakes of the Powder-room and fore sail room  <strike>and this was a nother reason why I put in here as  these things could not have been done at Sea &#151;</strike>
