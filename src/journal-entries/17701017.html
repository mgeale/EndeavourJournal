        Wednesday 17<sup>th</sup> In the <small>PM</small> I waited upon the Superintendant of Unrust with an order from the Sh<strike>ip</strike><sub>^</sub><sup>a</sup>bander to receive us at that Island, but this order the Superintendant told me was not sufficient to impower him to give me the conveniences and assistance I wanted; and when I came to call upon the Shabander I found this mistake was owing to the word, heave down, being wrong translated, this circumstance trifling as it is will cause a delay of some days as it cannot be set to rights untill next Councel day which is not till Friday.
