        Sunday 28<sup>th</sup> Winds Southerly and clear weather- This morning, my self, M<sup>r</sup> Banks and D<sup>r</sup> Solander set out in the Pinnace to pay Tootaha a Viset who had moved from apparra to the <small>SW</small> part of the Isl<sup>d</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;What induced us to make him this Viset was a message we had received from him some days ago importing that if we would go to him he would give us several Hogs, we had no great faith in this yet we was resolved to try, and set out accordingly, it was night before we reached the place where he was and as we had left the Boat about half way be hind us we were obliged to take up our quarters with him for the Night- The Chief received us in a very friendly manner and a Pig was order'd to be <strike>dress'd</strike> <sub>^</sub> <sup>kill'd &amp; dress'd</sup> for supper, but we saved his Life for the present thinking it would do us more service in a nother place and we supp'd on fruit and what else we could get; here was along with the Chief Obarea and many more that we knowed, they all seem'd to be travellers like ourselves, for nither the Canoes they had along with them nor the <strike>houses neither</strike> <sub>^</sub> <sup>houses where they were</sup> were sufficient to contain the one half of them. <strike>and after supper</strike> We were in all Six of us and after supper began to look out for lodgings, M<sup>r</sup> Banks went to one place &nbsp;D<sup>r</sup> Solander to a nother, while I and the other three went to a third, we all of us took as much care of the little we had about us as possible knowing very well what sort of people <sub>^</sub> <sup>we</sup> were a mong, yet notwithstanding all the care we took before 12 oClock the most of us had lost something or other, for my own part I had my stockings taken from under my head and yet I am certain that I was not a Sleep the whole time, Obarea, took charge of M<sup>r</sup> Banks's things and yet they were stolen from her as she pretended, Tootaha was acquainted with what had happen'd I believe by Obarea her <sub>^</sub> <sup>self</sup> and both he and her made some stir about it but this was all meer shew and ended in nothing; a little time after this Tootaha came to the Hutt where I and those that were with me lay and entertain'd us with a consort of Musick, consisting <sub>^</sub> <sup>of</sup> three Drums four Flutes and Singing, this lasted about an hour and then they retire'd; the Musick and si<sub>^</sub><sup>n</sup>ging was so much of a peice that I was very glad when it was over. We stay'd with them till near noon the next day in hopes of geting some of our things again, and likewise some Hogs but we were at last obliged to come a<sub>^</sub><sup>way</sup> with the one we had save'd out of the fire last night, and a promise from Tootaha that he would come to the Ship in a Day or two with more and bring with him the things that we had lost, a promise that we had no reason to expect he will fulfill. Thus ended our Viset and we got to the Fort late in the evening &#151;
