        Tuesday 21st. Winds at <small>EBS</small> and <small>ESE</small> a fresh breeze. By one oClock we had run nearly the length of the southermost of the two Islands before mentioned and finding that we could not well go to windward of them without carrying us too far from the Main land we bore up and run to Leeward <strike>of them</strike> where we found a fair open passage this done we steer'd <small>NBW</small> in a Parallel direction with the Main land leaving a small Island between us and it and some low sandy Isles and shoals without us all of which we lost sight of by 4 oClock, neither did we see any more before the sun went down at which time the farthest part of the Main in sight bore <small>NNW<sub>^</sub><small><small>1/2</small>W</small></small> &nbsp;&nbsp;soon after this we Anchord in 13 fathom soft ground about 5 Leagues from the land where we lay untill day light when we got again under sail, having first sent the Yawl ahead to sound, we steerd <small>NNW</small> by Compass from the northermost land in sight Variation 3&deg;..6' East: Seeing no danger in our way we took the Yawl in tow and made all the Sail we could untill 8 oClock at which time we discoverd Shoals ahead and on our Larboard bow and saw that the <strike>Land</strike> northermost land which we had taken to be a part of the Main was an Island or Islands between which and the Main their appeared to be <sup>a</sup> good passage thro' which we might pass by runing to Leeward of the Shoals on our Larboard bow which was now pretty near us. whereupon we wore and brought too and sent away the Pinnace and yawl to direct us clear of the shoals and then stood after them. after having got round the <small>SE</small> point of the Shoal we steerd <small>NW</small> along the <small>SW</small> or inside of it keeping a good look out at the Mast head having another shoal on our Larboard side, but we found a good channell of a Mile broad between them wherein were from 10 to 14 fathoms water&nbsp;&nbsp; At 11 oClock being nearly the Length of the Islands above mentioned and designing to pass between them and the Main, the Yawl being thrown a Stern by falling in upon a <sub>^</sub><sup>part of the</sup> shoal she could not get over we brought the Ship too and sent away the Long-boat / which we had a stern and rigg'd / to keep in shore upon our larboard bow and the Pinnace on the Starboard for all tho there appear'd <sub>^</sub><sup>to be</sup> nothing in the Passage yet I thought it necessary to take this method be cause we had a strong flood which carried us an end very fast, and it did not want much of high-water &nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as the boats were ahead we stood after them and got through by noon at which time we were by observation in the Latitude of 10&deg;..36'..30" S<sup>t</sup> the nearest part of the Main, and which we soon after found to be the Northermost bore <strike>due</strike> west <sub>^</sub><strike>a little</strike> <sup>2&deg; southerly</sup> distand 3 or 4 Miles, the Islands which form'd the Passage before mentioned extending from North to N. 75&deg; East distant 2 or 3 Miles - At the same time we saw Islands at a good distance off extending from <small>NBW</small> to <small>WNW</small> and behind them another chain of high land which we like wise Judge'd to be Islands, the Main land we thought extended as far as N 71&deg; west but this we found to be Islands. The point of the Main which forms one side of the <strike>M</strike> Passage before mentioned and which <strike>we found</strike> is the Northern Promontary of this <sub>^</sub><sup>Country</sup> I have named Y<u>ork Cape</u> in honour of His late Royal Highness the Duke of York. It lies in the Longitude of 218&deg;..24' W<sup>t</sup> the North point in y<sup>e</sup> Lat<sup>de</sup> of 10&deg;.37' S. &amp; the E<sup>t</sup> point in 10&deg;..41' S. The land over and to the <sub>^</sub><sup>Southward of this last point</sup> is rather low and very flat <sub>^</sub><sup>as far in land as the eye could rach</sup> and looks barren to the southward of the Cape the Shore forms a large open Bay <sub>^</sub><sup>which I called New Castle Bay</sup> wherein are some small low Islands and shoals and all the land about it is very low flat and sandy. The Land <sub>^</sub><sup>of the</sup> northern <sub>^</sub><sup>part</sup> of the Cape <strike>the land</strike> is rather more hilly and the shore forms some small Bays wherein there appear'd to be good anchorage, and the Vallies appear'd to be tolerably well Clo<sub>^</sub><sup>a</sup>thed with wood; close to the <sub>^</sub><sup>East</sup> point of the Cape are Three small Islands and a small ledge of rocks spiting off from one of them <sub>^</sub><sup>there is also an Island lay close to the north P<sup>t</sup></sup> &nbsp;the other Islands before spoke off <sub>^</sub><sup>forming the passage</sup> lay about 4 Miles without these, only Tow of them are of any extent, the Southermost is the largist and much higher than any part of the Main land, on the <small>NW</small> side of this Island seem'd to be good anchorage and Vallies that to all appearence would afford both wood and fresh water &nbsp;&nbsp;These Isles are known in the Chart by the name of York Isles &#151;
        
        <p>
        
        to the Southward and <small>SE</small> of them and even to the Eastward and northward are several low Islands &nbsp;&nbsp;Rocks and shoals - our depth of water in sailing between them and the Main was 12 . 13 &amp; 14 fathoms &#151;
