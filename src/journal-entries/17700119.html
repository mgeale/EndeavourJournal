        Friday 19<sup>th</sup> Winds and weather as yesterday and the employment of the people the same. In the <small>PM</small> some of our people found in the skirts of the Wood three hip bones of Men,&nbsp; they lay near to a hole or hoven, that is aplace where the natives dress their Victuals, this circumstance trifleing as it is, is still a further proff that this people eat human flesh &#151;

        In the <small>AM</small> set up the Forge to repair the braces of the Tiller and such other Iron work as <strike>is</strike> was wanting. The natives came along side and sold us a quantity of large Mackerel for nails peices of Cloth and paper, and in this traffeck they never once attemptd to defraud us of any one thing, but dealt as fair as people could do &#151;
