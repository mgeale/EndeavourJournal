        Saturday 1<sup>st</sup> In the <small>PM</small> and most part of the night had a fresh [breeze] from the <small>SE</small> with which we kept standing in for the land <small>NE</small> and <small>ENE</small> Close upon awind untill half an hour past 6 o'Clock, when we anchor'd in 4<small>1/2</small> fathom water a Soft Muddy bottom as we have every where found upon the Coast, about an hour before we Anchord we saw the land from the Mast head extending from <small>EBN</small> to <small>SSE</small> all very low. At the time we Anchor'd we found a small drean of a Tide Seting away to the <small>NW</small> which continued untill 2 oClock in the Morning &nbsp;&nbsp;when the water had fell 9 feet or better: this Tide of Ebb was than succeeded by the Flood which came from the <small>SW</small>, yet we did not find the water to rise much upon a perpendicular or else the greatest fall of the Tide had not been well <strike>at</strike> attended to in the night for at 6 oClock when we got under sail we had no more than 3 fathom under the Ship and yet we could not see the land from the deck - After getting under sail we stood to the northward with a light breeze at East and deepen'd our water <sub>^</sub><sup>by noon</sup> to 10 fathom, having the land just in sight from the Mast head to the <small>SE</small>.
