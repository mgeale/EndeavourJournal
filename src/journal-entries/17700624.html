        In the <small>PM</small> the Carpenters finish'd the Starboard side and at 9 oClock heel'd the Ship the other way and hauld her off about 2 feet for fear of neeping &nbsp;&nbsp;In the <small>AM</small> they went to work upon repairing the sheathing under the larboard bow - where we found two planks cut about half thro' - early in the morning I sent a party of men into the Country under the direction of M<sup>r</sup> Gore to seek for refreshments &nbsp;&nbsp;they returnd about noon with a few Palm Cabbages and a Bunch or 2 of wild Plantains. &nbsp;these last were much smaller than any I had ever seen and the Pulp full of small stones otherwise they were well taisted. I saw my self this morning a little way from the ship one of the Animals before spoke off, it was <sub>^</sub><sup>of a light Mouse colour and</sup> the full size of a grey hound and shaped in every respect like one with a long tail which it carried like a grey hound in short I should have taken it for a <strike>wolf or</strike> wild dog, but for its walking or runing in which it jump'd like a Hare or a dear &nbsp;&nbsp;another of them was seen <sub>^</sub><sup>to day</sup> by some of our people who saw the first, they describe them as having very small legs and the print of the foot like that of a goat but this I could not see my self because the ground the one I saw was upon was too hard and the length of the grass hinderd my seeing its legs &#151;
