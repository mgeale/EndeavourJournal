        Thursday 6<sup>th</sup> A Steady fresh gale at <small>EBS</small> and clear weather, with which we steerd <small>WSW</small> &nbsp;&nbsp;At 7 oClock in the evening, we took in the small Sails, Reef'd the Top sails and sounded having 50 fathom water. &nbsp;&nbsp;we still kept <small>WSW</small> all night going at the rate of 4<small>1/2</small> Miles an hour, at 10 oClock had <strike>37</strike> <sup>42</sup> f<sup>m</sup> 11 oClock <strike>45</strike> 37, 12 oClock 45, 1 oClock 49 and at 3 oClock 120 fathom after which we could get no ground. In the Evening we caught 2 Boobies which settled upon the rigging and these <strike>wre</strike> were the first of these Birds we <sub>^</sub><sup>have </sup>caught in this Manner the Voyage, Altho I have heard of them being caught this way in great numbers. At day light in the Morning we made all the sail we could and at 10 o'Clock saw land extending from <small>NNW</small> to <small>WBN</small> distant 5 or 6 Leagues - At Noon it bore from North to west and about the same distance, our Latitude by observation was 8&deg;.15' S<sub>t</sub> Long<sup>de</sup> 227&deg;-47' W<sup>t</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Land is of an even and moderate height and by our run from New Guinea ought to be a part of the <u>Arow Isles</u>, but it lays a Degree farther to the South than any of these Islands are laid down in the Charts. We sounded but had no ground with 50 fathoms of line &#151;
