        Sunday 20<sup>th</sup> Winds southerly  gentle breezes, At 1 oClock in the <sup>PM</sup> we pass'd  <sub>^</sub><sup>at the distance of 4  Miles having 17 f<sup>m</sup> water</sup> a  black bluf head or point of land on which a number of the natives were assembled,  which occasioned my nameing it I<u>ndian Head</u> /  Lat<sup>de</sup> 25&deg; 0' / NBW. 4 Miles from this head  <strike>the</strike> is a nother much like it, from this last  the land trends a little more to the westward and low and sandy next the Sea,  for what may be behind it we know not &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if land it must be <sub>^</sub><sup>all</sup>  very low for we could see no part of it from the mast head. We saw people in  other places besides the one I have mentioned, some smooks in the day and fires  in the night. Having but little wind all night we kept on to the northward -  haveing from 17 to 34 fathom water from 4 Miles to 4 Leagues from the land.  &nbsp;the northermost part of which bore from us at day light <small>W<sup>SW</sup></small>  and seem'd to End in a point from which we discover'd a reef stretching out  <sub>^</sub><sup>to the northward</sup>  as far as we could see, being at this time in 18 fathom water &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for  we had before it was light hauld our wind to the westward and this course we  continued untill we had plainly discoverd breakers a long way upon our lee bow  which s<strike>aw</strike>eemd to stretch quite home to the  land, we than edge'd away <sup>NW</sup> and <small>N<sup>NW</sup></small>  along the East side of the shoal from 2 to 1 Mile off having regular even soundings  from 13 to 7 fathom a fine sandy bottom - At Noon we were by observation in  the Latitude of 24&deg;..26' S<sup>o</sup> which was <strike>9</strike>  <sup>13</sup> Miles to the northward of that given by the  Log. the extreme point of the <strike>reef</strike> <sup>Shoal</sup>  we judged to bear about <sup>NW</sup> from us and the  point of land above mentioned bore <small>S<small>3/4</small>W</small>  distant 20 Miles, this point I have named Sandy Cape on accou[n]t of two very  large white patches of Sand upon it, it is of a height sufficient to be seen  12 Leagues in clear weather / Lat<sup>de</sup> 24&deg;..46',  Long<sup>de</sup> 206 &deg;.51' / from it the Land trended  away <small>W<sup>SW</sup></small>  and <sup>SW</sup> as far as we could see &#151;
