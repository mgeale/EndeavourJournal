        Monday 24<sup>th</sup> Winds at East and <small>SE</small> a Moderate breeze and fine pleasent weather. In the Evening found the Variation to be 2&deg;.44' West &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Noon our Latitude was 11&deg;.8' S<sup>t</sup> Longitude 242&deg;..23' West &#151; Sence we have been clear of the Islands we have had constantly a swell from the <strike> <small>NW</small></strike> Southward which I do not suppose is owning to the Winds b[l]owing any where from thence, but to the Sea being so determined by the position of the Coast of New-Holland &#151;
