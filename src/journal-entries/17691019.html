        Thursday, 19<sup>th</sup> The first part had gentle breezes at East and <small>ENE</small>.

Notwithstanding that these people had heard of the treatment the others had met with who had been on board before. yet it appear'd a little strange that they should place so much confidence in us as to put themselves wholy in our power wether we would or no, especi<sub>^</sub><sup>al</sup>ly as the others we had meet with in this Bay had upon every occation beheaved in a quite a different manner &#151; At 11 brought too untill daylight / the night being dark and rainy / then made sail, at 7 <small>AM</small> brought too under Cape Table and set away the Indian Canoe; at this time some others were puting off from the shore, but we did not wait their coming but made sail to the Northward - At Noon the northermost land in sight N<sup>o</sup> 20&deg; E<sup>t</sup>, and Young Nicks head or the South point of Poverty Bay, West northerly near 4 Leag<sup>s</sup> Lat.
