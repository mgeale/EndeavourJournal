        I made a little excursion in the Pinnace in order to take a View of the Bay, accompanied by M<sup>r</sup> Banks and D<sup>r</sup> Solander, We met with nothing remarkable and as we were on the west side of the Bay where the land is so closely cover'd with Wood that we could not penetrate into the Country &#151;
