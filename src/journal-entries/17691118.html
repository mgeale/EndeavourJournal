        Kept plying to windward under Close reef'd Top<sup>ls</sup> untill day light<small> AM</small>, at which time we had got close under the Main.&nbsp;&nbsp; and the wind coming at <small>SE</small> we made sail and steer'd <small>NWBW</small> as the land lays keeping close in shore - At 6 we pass a small Bay wherein there appear'd to Anchorage and pretty good shelter from the sea winds, at the entrence of which lies a Rock pretty high above water. 4 Miles farther to the west <small>N</small>. West is a very conspicuous promontory or Point of land which we got abreast of by 7 oClock It lies in the Latitude of 36&deg;..26' S<sup>o</sup> and N 48&deg; West 9 Leagues from <strike>the north head of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bay</strike> <sup>Point Mercury</sup> From this point the land trends W<small>1/2</small> S, near one League then <small>SSE</small> as far as we could see. Besides the Islands laying without us we could see land round by the <small>S.W.</small> as far as <small>NW.</small> but wheather this was the Main or Islands was not possible for us at this time to determine. &nbsp;&nbsp;the fear of looseing the Main land determined me to follow its diriction, with this View we ha<sub>^</sub><sup>u</sup>led round the point and Steer'd to the Southward, but meeting with whifleing light airs all round the Compass we made but little progress untill noon, when we found our selves by observation in the Lat<sup>d</sup> of 36&deg;..29' S<sup>o</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;A small Island which lies <small>NW</small> 4 Miles from the promontory above mentioned bore <small>NBE</small> distant 6<small>1/2</small> Miles.&nbsp;&nbsp; being at this time about 2 Miles from the Shore. While we lay under the land two large Canoes came off to us, in one of them <strike>was</strike> <sup>were</sup> 62 people, they stay'd about us some time then began to throw stones into the Ship.&nbsp;&nbsp; upon which I fired a Musquet ball thro' one of the boats, after this they retired ashore
