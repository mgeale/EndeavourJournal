        Wednesday 5<sup>th</sup> Winds at <small>EBS</small> and <small>SEBE</small> a fresh gale and clear weather, with which we run 118 Miles upon a S 69&deg;..15' west Course, which at Noon brought us into the Latitude of 7&deg;..25' S<sup>t</sup> Longitude 225&deg;..41' West, depth of water 28 fathoms, having been in soundings the whole of this Days run generaly between 10 and 20 fathoms. At half an hour past one in the Morning we past by a small low Island which bore from us at that time <small>NNW</small> distant 3 or 4 Miles, depth of water 14 fathom, and at Day light we discover'd another low - Island extending from <small>NNW</small> to <small>NNE</small> distant 2 or 3 Leagues, &nbsp;&nbsp;I beleive I should have landed upon this Island to have known its produce as it did not appear to be very small had not the wind blown too fresh for such an undertaking and at the time we pass'd the Island we had only 10 fathom water a rocky bottom, I was therefore afraid <sub>^</sub><sup>of</sup> runing down to leeward for fear of meeting with shoal<strike>d</strike> water and foul ground - <strike>As</strike> These Islands have no <sub><strike>^</strike></sub><strike><sup>proper</sup></strike> place in the Charts unless they are the Arrow Isles, which if they are they are laid down much too far from New-Guiney &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found the South part of these to lay in the Lat<sup>de</sup> 7&deg;..6' S<sup>t</sup> Long<sup>de</sup> 225&deg;..0' West &#151;
