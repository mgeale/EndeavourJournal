        Friday 23<sup>d</sup> Winds southerly a gentle breeze and for the most part Clowdy weather. At sun set, the weather clearing up presented to our View a high peaked mountain bearing <small>NWBN</small>; and at the same time we saw the land more distincter than we had at any time before, extending from North to <small>SWBS</small>, the inland parts of which appear'd to be high and mountainous. We cannot tell yet w<sub>^</sub><sup>h</sup>ether or no this land joins to or makes a part of the land w[e] have left &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the accounts recieved of the Natives of Queen Charlottes Sound it ought not because if it did it must have been impossible for us to have sail'd round it in four days; besides, the mountains in land and the Soundings off the Coast seem to indicate this Country to be more extensive than any they spoke of lying to the southward &#151;

        Having a large hollow swell from the south East which made me expect the wind from the same quarter, we kept plying from 7 to 15 Leagues from the land, depth of water from 44 to 70 fathoms. At Noon our Latitude by observation was 44&deg;..40' S<sup>o</sup> Longitude made from Banks's Island 1&deg;..31' West &#151;
