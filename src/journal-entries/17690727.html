        Thursday 27<sup>th</sup> Variable light Airs of wind in the <small>SW</small> quarter and fair weather. Seeing that there is a broad Channell between Otaha and Bolabola I intend to go thro' that way and not run to the northward of all; but as the wind is right on end and very Variable withall we got little or no ground - Between 5 and 6 oClock <small>P.M</small> as we were standing to the Northward we discover'd a Small low Island lying <small>NBW</small> or <small>NNW</small> distant 4 or 5 Leagues from Bolabola, &nbsp;&nbsp;this Island is called <u>Tubai</u>. T<strike>obia</strike>upia says it produceth nothing but a few Cocoa-nuts; that there are only three Families live upon it, but that the people from these Islands resort thither to catch fish. &nbsp;&nbsp;At Noon the Pe<sub>^</sub><sup>a</sup>k of <u>Bolabola</u> bore N. 25&deg; West and the North end of <u>Otaha</u> N 80&deg; West distant 3 Leagues &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lat<sup>d</sup> Ob<sup>d</sup> 16&deg;..38' South &#151;
