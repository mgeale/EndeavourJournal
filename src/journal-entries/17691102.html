        Thursday 2<sup>nd</sup> Gentle breeze from NW. round northerly to <small>ESE</small> and fair weather - At 2 <small>P.M</small> saw a pretty high Island bearing west from us and at 5 Saw more Islands and Rocks to the westward of it; hauld our wind in order to go without them but finding that we could not weather them before dark, bore up and run between them and the main &nbsp;&nbsp;At 7 was close under the first Island from whence a large double Canoe full of people came off to us &nbsp;&nbsp;this was the first double Canoe we had seen in this Country. they stayd about the Ship untill it was dark then left us, but not before they had thrown a few stones: they told us the name of the Island which was <u>Mowtohora</u> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is but of a small circuit but high and lies 6 - Miles from the Main, under <sup>the south side is anchorage in 14 fathom water</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>SWB</small><sub>^</sub><sup>S</sup> from this Island on the main land, seemingly at no great distance from the sea is a <strike>very</strike> high round mountain <sub>^</sub><sup>which I have named Mount Edgcomb &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it</sup> stand<strike>ing</strike><sup>s</sup> in the middle of <strike>some low flat land</strike> <sup>a large plane</sup> which makes it the more conspicuous &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>Latitude 37&deg;..59' Long<sup>d</sup> 183&deg; 07-</sup> <strike>Under the south side of the Island is anchorage in 14 f<sup>m</sup> Water</strike>. In standing to the westward we shoalden'd our water from 17 to 1<strike>3</strike>0 fathom, and knowing that we were not far from some <sub>^</sub><sup>small</sup> Islands, and Rocks that <strike>that</strike> we had seen before dark, after pass<sub>^</sub><sup>ing of which</sup> <strike>of these</strike> I intended to have brought too for the night, but now I thought it more prudent to tack and spend the night under the Island <u>Mowtohora</u> where I knowd there was no danger, and it was well we did for in the morning after we had made sail to the westward we discover'd ahead of us Rocks level with and under water; they lay 1<small>1/2</small> League from the Island <u>Mowtohora</u> and about 9 Miles from the Main. <sup>and <small>NNE</small> from <u>Mount Edgcumbe</u></sup>. We pass'd between these rocks and the Main having from 7 to 10 fathom water. The Double Canoe which we saw last night follow'd us again to day under sail and kept abreast of the Ship near an houre talking to T<strike>ob</strike>upia but at last they began to pelt us with stones but upon fireing one Musquet they drop'd a stern and left us &#151; At half past 10 pass'd between a low flat Island and the Main the distance from one to the other being 4 Miles depth of water 10, 12 and 15 fathom &#151; At Noon the Flat Island bore from N.E to E<small>1/2</small>N distant 5 or 6 Miles, <strike>Course and distance run since yesterday at noon is</strike> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strike>Leagues</strike> Latitude in per Observation 37&deg;..39' S<sup>o</sup> <sub>^</sub><sup>Long<sup>d</sup> 183.30</sup> The Main land between this and the Island of <u>Mowtohara</u> <sub>^</sub><sup>which is [10 - check this ] Leagues</sup> is of a Moderate height and all a level flat Country pritty clear of wood and full of Plantations and Villages; <strike>this</strike> these Villages are built upon eminences near the Sea. and are fortified on the land side with a Bank and a Ditch, and Pallisaded all round, besides this some of them appear'd to have out wo<sub>^</sub><sup>r</sup>ks &#151;
        
        <p>
        
        We have before now observed on several parts of the Coast small Villages inclosed with Pallisades, and Works of this kind built <sub>^</sub><sup>on</sup> eminences and ridges of hills, but T<strike>ob</strike>upia hath all along told us that they were Mories or places of Worship, but I rather think that they are places of retreat <sub>^</sub><sup>or Stronghold</sup> where they defend themselves againest the Attack of an Enimy as some of them seem'd not ill design'd for that purpose. <strike>We saw haled a shore under one of the Villages canoes which carried a small awning or little cabbin, a thing we have not seen before on this coast.</strike>
