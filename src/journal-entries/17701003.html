        Wednesday 3<sup>rd</sup> Soon after 12 oClock it fell quite Calm which obliged us to anchor in 18 f<sup>m</sup> a muddy bottom, about 2 Miles from shore where we found a Strong Current seting to the <small>SW</small> &#151;
        
        <p>
        
        Not long before we anchord we saw a Dutch Ship laying off Anger Point, on board which I sent M<sup>r</sup> Hicks to inquire after news, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon his return he inform'd me that there were Two Dutch Ships from Batavia the one bound to Ceylon and the other to the Coast of Mallabar, besides a small Fly Boat or Packet, which is stationed here to carry Packets, Letters &amp;C<sup>a</sup> from all Dutch Ships to Batavia; but it seems more Probable that she is stationed here to examine all Ships that pass and repass these Streights. We now first heard the Agreeable News of His Majestys Sloop the Swallow being at Batavia about two years ago. At 7 oClock a breeze sprung up at <small>SSW</small>, with which we weigh'd and stood to the <small>NE</small> between Thward the way Island and the Cap, Soundings from 18 to 26 fathom. We had but little wind all <sub>^</sub><sup>night</sup> and having a strong Current against us we got no farther by 8 oClock in the Morning than under Bantam Point, at this time the Wind came to <small>NE</small> and obliged us to Anchor in 22 fathom about 2 Miles from the Shore, the above Point bore <small>NEBE</small> distant 1 League - here we found a Strong Current seting to the NW &#151;
        
        <p>
        
        In the Morning we saw the Dutch Packet Standing after us, but after the wind shifted to <small>NE</small> she bore away &#151;
        
        <p>
        
        One of the Dutch Captains told M<sup>r</sup> Hicks Yesterday that the Current sets Constantly to the <small>SW</small> ward and that it would continue to set so for a Mo[n]th or Six Weeks longer
