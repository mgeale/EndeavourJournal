        Sunday 22<sup>d</sup> Fresh breezes at <small>SE</small> and <small>ESE</small>. Employ'd as yesterday. In the <small>AM</small> as the wind would not permit us to sail I sent the yawl out to catch turtle in opening of one to day we found sticking thro' both shoulder bones a wood<sub>^</sub><sup>on</sup> harpoon or turtle peg 15 Inches long bearbed at the end such as we have seen among the natives, this proves to a demonstration that they strike turtle I suppose at the time they come aShore to lay their Eggs for they certainly have no boat fit to do this at sea or that will carry a turtle and this harpoon must have been a good while in as the wound was quite heald up &#151;
