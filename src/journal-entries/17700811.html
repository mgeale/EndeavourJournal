        Saturday 11<sup>th</sup> Fresh breezes at <small>SSE</small> and <small>SEBS </small>with which we steerd along shore <small>NWBW</small> untill one oClock, when the Petty officer at the mast head call'd out that he saw land ahead extending quite round to the Islands without us and a large Reef between us and the<sup>m</sup> <strike>Islands</strike> &#151; upon this I went to the mast head my self, the Reef I saw very plain which was now so far to wind ward <strike>of us</strike> that we could not weather it, but what he took for main land ahead were only small Islands, for such they appear'd to me but before I had well got from mast head the Master and some others went up who all asserted that it was a continuation of the main land and to make it still more alarming they said they saw breakers in a manner all round us. We emmediatly hauld <strike>the</strike> upon a wind in for the land and made <sub>^</sub><sup>the</sup> Signal for the boat <sub>^</sub><sup>which was ahead sounding</sup> to come on board, but as she was well to leeward, we were obliged to edge away to take her up and soon after came too an Anchor under a point of the Main in <small>1/4</small> less 5 fathom about a Mile from the Shore Cape Flattery &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bearing <small>SE</small> &#151; distant 3<small>1/2</small> Leagues &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this I landed and went upon the point which is pretty high from which I had a view of the sea-Coast which trended away <small>NWBW</small> 8 or 10 Leagues which was as far as I could see, the weather not being very clear. I likewise saw 9 or 10 <sub>^</sub><sup>small</sup> low Islands and some shoals laying of the Coast and some large shoals between the Main and the three high Islands without, which I was now well assured were Islands and not a part of the Main land as some had taken them to be, Excepting Cape Flattery and the Point I am now upon which I have named Point Lookout the Mainland next the Sea to the Northward of Cape Bedford &#151; is low and Chequer'd with White Sand and Green Bushes &amp;C<sup>a</sup> for 10 or 12 Miles in land behond which is high lands. To the northward of Point Lookout the shore appeard to be shoald and flat some distance off, which was <strike>not</strike> <sub>^</sub><sup>no</sup> good sign of meeting with a channel in with the land as we have hitherto done &nbsp;&nbsp;We saw the foot steps of People upon the Sand and smook and fire up in the Country and in the evening return'd on board where I came to a resolution to Visit one of the high Islands in the offing in my Boat as the<sup>y</sup> lay at least 5 Leagues out to sea and seem'd to be of such a hieght that from the top of one of them I hoped to see and find a Passage out to sea clear of the shoals; accordingly in the morning I set out in the Pinnace for the northermost and largest of the three accompaned by M<sup>r</sup> Banks, at the same time I sent the Master in the Yawl to lee-ward to sound between the <sub>^</sub><sup>low</sup> Islands and the Main. In my way to the Island I pass'd over a large Reef of Coral Rocks and sand which lies about two Leagues from the Island &nbsp;&nbsp;I left a nother to lee ward which lays about 3 Miles from the Island on the North part of this is a low sandy Isle with trees upon it. on the reef we pas'd over in the boat we saw several turtle and chased one or two but caught none it blowing too hard and I had no<strike>t</strike> time to spare being otherways employ'd. I did not reach the Island untill half an hour after one oClock in the <small>PM</small> on
