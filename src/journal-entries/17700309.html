        Friday 9<sup>th</sup> <small>PM</small> winds at North a gentle breeze and clear weather. Stood to the westward untill sun set at which time the extremes of the land bore from <small>NBE</small> to West distant about 7 or 8 Leagues <sub>^</sub><sup>depth of water 55 f<sup>m</sup></sup>. Variation by the Amp<sup>d</sup> 16&deg;.29' E<sup>t</sup> The wind now veer'd to the westward and as the weather was fine and Moon light we kept standing close upon a wind to the <small>SW</small> all night: at 4 <small>AM</small> sounded and had 60 f<sup>m</sup> At day light we discover'd under our lee bow a ledge of rocks / on which the sea broke very high / extend from <small>SBW</small> to <small>WBS</small> and not above <small>3/4</small> of a Mile from us, yet upon sounding we had 45 f<sup>m</sup> water a rocky bottom. The wind being at <small>N.W.</small> we could not weather the Ledge and <sub>^</sub><sup>as</sup> I did not care to run to Leeward we tacked and made a trip to the Eastward, but the wind soon after coming to north inabled us to go clear of all &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our soundings in passing within the Ledge was from 35 to 47 f<sup>m</sup> a rocky bottom - This Ledge lies <small>SE</small> Six Leagues from the southermost part of the land and <small>SEBS</small> from some remarkable hills which stand near the Shore. These rocks are not the only dangers that lay here for about three leagues to the northward of them is a nother ledge of rocks laying full three Leagues from the land whereon the sea broke very high, as we pass'd these rocks in the night at no great distance and discover'd the others close under our lee at day light it is apparent that we had a very fortunate escape <sub>^</sub><sup>I have named them the Traps because they lay as such to catch unweary strangers</sup> &#151; At Noon our Latitude by Observation was 47&deg;..26' S<sup>o</sup> Long<sup>de</sup> made from Cape Saunders 3&deg;..4' W<sup>t</sup> The land in sight / which has very much the appearence of an Island / extending from <small>NEBN</small> to <small>NWBW</small> distant from the shore about 4 or 5 Leagues - the eastermost Ledge of rocks bore <small>SSE</small> distant 1<small>1/2</small> Leagues and Northermost <small> NE <small>1/2</small>E</small> 3 Leagues. This land is of a moderate height and hath avery barren Aspect, not a tree to be seen upon it only a few small shrubs. There were several white patches on which the Suns rays reflected very strongly which I take to be a kind of Marble such as we have seen in ma<sub>^</sub><sup>n</sup>y places of this country, particularly to the northward &#151;
