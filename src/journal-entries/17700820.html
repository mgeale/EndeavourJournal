        Monday 20<sup>th</sup> Fresh breezes and <small>ESE</small>, &nbsp;&nbsp;about one oClock the Pinnace having got ahead and the Yawl we took in tow, we fill'd and Steerd <small>NBW</small> for some small Islands we had in that direction, after aproaching them a little nearer we found them joind or connected together by a large Reef upon this we Edge'd away <small>NW</small> and left them a starboard steering between them and the Islands laying off the Main, having a fair and clear passage depth of water from 15 to 23 f<sup>m</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;At 4 oClock we discover'd some low Islands <sub>^</sub><sup>and Rocks</sup> bearing <small>WNW</small> which we stood directly for. At half past 6 oClock we Anchord on the <small>NE</small> side of the northermost in 16 fathom water distant from the Island one mile <sub>^</sub><sup>The Isles lay <small>NW</small> 4 Leagues from C. Granville, on these Isles we saw a good many Birds which occasioned my calling them Bird Isles&#151;</sup>

        Before and at sun set we could see the Main land which appear'd all very low and sandy extend as far to the Northward <sub>^</sub><sup>as</sup> <small>NWBN</small>, and some Shoals, Keys and low sandy Isles away to the <small>NE</small> of us -

        At 6 oClock in the Morning we got again under sail with a fresh breeze at East and stood away <small>NNW</small> for <strike>an</strike> <sub>^</sub><sup>some low</sup> Islands we saw in that diretion, but we had not stood <strike>on</strike> <sub>^</sub><sup>long</sup> upon this Course before we were obliged to haul close upon a wind in order to weather a Shoal which we discover'd on our Larboard bow, having at the same time <strike>two large</strike> <sup>others</sup> to the Eastward of us, By such time as we had weather'd the Shoal to Leeward we had brought the Islands well upon our Lee-bow, but seeing some shoals spit off from them and some Rocks on our starboard bow which we did not discover untill we were very near them, made me afraid to go to windward of the Islands, wherefore we brought too, and made the Signal for the Pinnace, which was a head to come on board, which done I sent her to leeward of the Islands with orders to keep along the Edge of the Shoal which spited off from the South side of the Southermost Island. The Yawl I sent to run over the Shoal to look for Turtle and appointed them a Signal to make in case they saw many, if not she was to meet us on the other side of the Island. As soon as the Pinnace had got a proper distance from us we wore and stood after her and run to Leeward of the Island where we took the Yawl in tow - she having seen only one small Turtle and therefore made no stay upon the Shoal &nbsp;&nbsp;Upon this Island which is only a small spot of Sand with some trees upon it, we saw a good many hutts or habitations of the Natives which we supposed comes over from the Main to these Isl<sup>ds</sup> / from which they are distant about 5 Leagues / to Catch Turtle at the time these <sub>^</sub><sup>Animals</sup> come a Shore to lay their Eggs. Having got the yawl in tow we stood away after the Pinnace <small>NNE</small> and <small>NBE</small> to two other low Islands, having two shoals which we could see without us and one between us and the Main. At Noon we were about 4 Leagues from the Main Land which we could see extending to the Northward as far as <small>NWBN</small> all low flat and sandy, our Latitude by observation was 11&deg; 23' S<sup>t</sup> Longitude in 217&deg;..46' West and Course and distance saild sence yesterday at Noon North 22&deg; West 40 Miles - Soundings from 14 to 23 fathom, but these are best seen upon the Chart as likewise the Islands shoals &amp;C<sup>a</sup> which are too numerous to be mentioned singly &#151;
