And the  mean of M<sup>r</sup> Greens Computations from the same  Observations was 66&deg;.14' .0" and the mean of his computations and mine will  be 66&deg;.. 11'..32"; and therefore the Longitude of Cape S<sup>t</sup>  Diego or the NW entrance of Strat Le Maire will be 66&deg;.. 0'..0" West from  Greenwich and its Lat<sup>d</sup> is 54&deg;.. 39' South-  Note, the distance of the Sun and Moon were taken by Mr Green alone, my Quadrant  being out of order &#151;
