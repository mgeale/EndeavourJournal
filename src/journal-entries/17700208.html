        Thursday 8<sup>th</sup> In the <small>PM</small> had a fresh breeze at <small>NNE</small> and Clowdy weather. At 3 oClock we were abreast of the <sub>^</sub><sup>Southermost</sup> point of land set at noon which I named <u>Cape Campbel</u> / Lat<sup>de</sup> 41&deg;..42' S<sup>o</sup> Long<sup>de</sup> 184&deg;..47' W<sup>t</sup> / it lies <small>SBW</small> dist<sup>t</sup> 12 or 13 Leagues from Cape <u>Koam</u>aroo and together with Cape Pallisser forms the Southern entrance of the Straits<sup>, the dist<sup>ce</sup> of the one to the other is 13 or 14 Leagues WBS &amp; EBN&#151;</sup>

        From this Cape we steer'd along shore <small>SWBS</small> until 8 oClock when the wind died away, but an hour after a fresh breeze sprung up at <small>SW</small> and we put the Ship right before it. The reasons of my doing this was owing to a notion which some of the officers had just started that Ae<u>heinomouwe</u> was not an Island founding their opinion on a suppotision that the land might extend away to the <small>SE</small> from between Cape Turn-again and <strike>the point we saw at noon</strike> <sup>Cape Pallisser</sup> &nbsp;there being a space of about <sub>^</sub><sup>12 or</sup> 15 Leagues which we had not seen. For my own part I had seen so far into this Sea the first time I discover'd the Strait, together with many other concurrent testimonies of its being an Island that no such supposition ever enter'd my thoughts &nbsp;but being resolved to clear up every doubt that might arise on so important an object I took the oppertunity of the shifting of the winds to stand to the Eastward and accordingly steer'd <small>NEBE</small> all night. At 9 oClock <small>AM</small> we <strike>was</strike> <sup>were</sup> abreast of <strike>the Southermost point of</strike>&nbsp; <sup>Cape Pallisser</sup> where we found the Land trend away <small>NE</small> towards Cape Turn-again which I reckoned to be distant from us about 26 Leagues: but as the weather was hazey so that we could not see above 4 or 5 Leagues ahead we still kept standing to the <small>NE</small> with a light breeze at South. A Noon Cape Pallisser bore N.72&deg; West distant 3 Leagues, our Lat<sup>d</sup> by account is 41&deg;..30' South &#151;
