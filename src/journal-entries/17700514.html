        After this we got the wind southerly a fresh breeze and fair weather and we steerd <small>NBW</small> for the northermost land we had in sight. At Noon we were about 4 Leagues from the land and by observation in the Latitude of 30&deg;..22' S<sup>o</sup> which was 9 Miles to the southward of that given by the Log. Longitude in 206&deg;..39' W<sup>t</sup> and course and distance made good sence yesterday noon N<sup>o</sup> 16&deg; East 22 Miles - Some tolerable high land near the shore bore west - As I have not mentiond the aspect of the Country sence we left<strike> <u>Botanist</u></strike>&nbsp;^<u>Bottany</u> <u>Bay</u> <strike>Harbour</strike> <strike>Bay</strike> I shall now discribe it as it hath at different times appeard to us. As we have advanced to the northward the land hath increased in height in so much that in this latitude it may be call'd a hilly country but between this and <strike>Sting</strike> <sup>Botany</sup> <strike>Ray harbour</strike> Bay it is diversified with an agreeable variety of hils ridges Vallies and large planes all cloathed with wood which to all appearence is the same as I have before mentiond &nbsp;&nbsp;as we could discover no Visible alteration in the soil near the shore the land is in general low and sandy except the points which are rocky and over many of them are pretty high hills which at first rising out of the water appear like Islands
