        Wednesday 25<sup>th</sup>  of Jan<sup>ry</sup> Winds from the South to the <small>WNW</small>,  the first part fresh gales and squally with some rain, middle little wind with  hail and rain, latter, fresh gales and hazey with showers of rain&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  at 8 <small>PM</small> the Island of Evouts <small>N.W.</small>  dist<sup>t</sup> 3 or 4 Miles - &nbsp;&nbsp;Variation  p<sup>r</sup> morning Amplitude 21&deg;..16' East. At  8 <small>AM</small> the Souther most low point of land seen  yesterday boare S<sup>o</sup> 74&deg; W<sup>t</sup>  and a remarkable Peeked Hill to the Southward of it <small>S.W.</small>  and soon after we discoverd that the land which we took yesterday to be apart  of the main or an Island, was three Islands which I take <sub>^</sub><sup>to</sup>  be Hermites, &nbsp;&nbsp;at Noon the south point of the Southermost Island bore  <small>NWBW</small>  dist<sup>t</sup> 3 Leagues, having then 55 fathom Peble  stones; this Point is pretty high and <strike>compared</strike>  <sub>^</sub><sup>consists</sup> of Peeked  craggy rocks and not far from it lay several others high above water; it lies  in the Latitude of 55&deg;.53' South and <small>SW</small>  26 Leagues from Strait La Mair, and by some on board thought to be Cape Horn,  but I was of another oppinion and with good reason because we saw land to the  southward of it about 3 or 4 Leagues&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it appeared not  unlike and Island with a very high round hummock upon it: this I believe to  be Cape Horn for after we had stood to the Southward about 3 Leagues the weather  clear'd up for about a <small>1/4</small> of an hour which gave us a sight of this land  bearing then <small>WSW</small> but we could see no land  either to the Southward or Westward of it, and therefore conclude that it must  be the Cape, but whether it be an Island of it self, apart of the Souther most  of Hermites Islands or a part of Terra del Fuego I am not able to determine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  however this is of very little concequence to Navigation, I only wished to have  been certain whether or no it was the Southermost Land on or near to Terra del  Fuego, but the thick Foggy weather, and the westerly winds which carried us  from the land prevented me from satisfying My curiosity in this point; but from  its Latitude and the reasons before given I think it must, and if so it must  be Cape Horn and lies in the Latitude of 55&deg;..59' South and Longitude 68&deg;..13'  - West from the Meridian of Greenwich, beeing the mean result of Several Observ<sup>ns</sup>  of the Sun and Moon made the day after we left the land, and which agree'd with  those made at Straits Le Maire, allowing for the distance between one place  and the other, which I found means very accuratly to determine: &nbsp;As we  are now about takeing our departure from the land which we are not likely to  fall in with again, I shall give a more full discription of such parts of the  Coast of Terra del Fuego as have fallen under my inspection &#151;
