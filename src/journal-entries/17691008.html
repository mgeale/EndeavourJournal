        Sunday 8<sup>th</sup> Gentle breezes between the <small>ENE</small> and north, clear weather. At 5 <small>PM</small> seeing the opening of a Bay that appear'd to run pretty far inland, hauled our wind and stood in for it, but as soon as night came on we kept plying on and off untill day light when we found our selves to Leeward of the Bay the wind being at north. By noon we fetched in with the <small>SW</small> point, but not being able to weather it we tacked and stood off. We saw in the Bay several Canoes, People upon the shore and some houses in the country. The land on the Sea-Coast is high with steep clifts and back inland are very high mountains &nbsp;&nbsp;the face of the Country is of a hilly surface and appeares to be clo<sub>^</sub><sup>a</sup>thed with wood and Verdure &#151;
