        Saturday 26<sup>th</sup> In the <sup>PM</sup> had a light breeze at <small>E<sup>SE</sup></small> <strike>untill 4 oClock</strike> <sup>with</sup> which we stood to the <sup>NW</sup> untill 4 <sub>^</sub><sup>o'Clock</sup> when it fell calm and soon after we Anchor'd in 12 fathom water &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cape Capricorn bearing S<sup>o</sup> 54&deg; East distant 4 Leagues having the Main land and Islands in a manner allround us - in the night we found the tide to rise and fall near 7 feet and the flood to set to the west ward and Ebb to the Eastward, which is the very reverse to what <sub>^</sub><sup>we found it when at Anchor to the Eastward of Bustard Bay</sup> <strike>I expected</strike> At 6 in the <sup>AM</sup> we weigh'd with the wind at South a gentle breeze and stood away to the <sup>NW</sup> between the outermost raing of Islands and the Main land, leaving several small Island between us and the latter which we passd close by - our soundings was a little erregular from 12 to 4 fathom which caused me to send a boat a head to sound. At Noon we were about 3 Miles from the Main, about the same distance from the Islands without us, our Latitude by obs<sup>n</sup> was 23&deg;.7' S<sup>o</sup> and Longitude made from Cape Capricorn 18 Miles west - The Main land in this Latitude is tolerable high and Mountainious and the Islands which lay off it are the most of them pretty high and of a small circuit and have more the appearence of barrenness than fertillity -

        We saw smooks a good way inland which makes me think there must be a River Lagoon or Inlet into the Country and we pass'd two places that had the appearence of such this morning, but our depth of water at that time was too <sub>^</sub><sup>little</sup> to haul in for them where I might expect to meet with less -
