At low water in the <small>PM</small> had hardly 4 feet water under the ship yet could not repair the sheathing that was beat off the place being all under water, &nbsp;&nbsp;one of the Carpenters crew, a Man I could trust, went down and examined it and found three streaks of the sheathing gone about 7 or 8 feet long and the Main plank a little rub'd, this accout agrees with the <sub>^</sub><sup>report of the</sup> Master and others that were under her bottom before. The Carpenter who I look upon to be well skilld in his profission and a good judge of these matters was of opinion that this was of little concequence and as I found that it would be difficult if not impractical for us to get under her bottom to repair it, I resolved to spend no more time about <sub>^</sub><sup>it</sup> accordingly at High-water hove her off and Moor'd her along side the beach where the stores &amp;C<sup>a</sup> lay and in the <small>AM</small> got everything in readiness for takeing them on board and at the same time got on board 8 tuns of water and stowed in the ground tier in the after hold. In the Morning M<sup>r</sup> Banks and Lieut<sup>t</sup> Gore with three men went in a small boat up the <strike>harbour</strike> River with a view to stay two or 3 days to try to kill some of the animals we have seen about this place
