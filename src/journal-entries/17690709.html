        Sunday July 9<sup>th</sup> When sometime in the Middle Watch Clement Webb &amp; Sam<sup>l</sup> Gibson both Marines &amp; young Men found means to get away from the Fort / which was now no hard matter to do / &amp; in the morning were not to be found, as it was known to every body that all hands were to go on board on the monday morning &amp; that the ship would sail in a day or 2, there was reason to think that these 2 Men intended to stay behind, However I was willing to stay one day to see if they would return before I took any step to find them.
