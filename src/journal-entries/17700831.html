        Friday 31<sup>st</sup> Between 12 and 1 in the <small>PM</small> steerd <small>WNW</small> in which time we shoalen'd our water from 8 to 5<small>1/2</small> fathoms, which I thought was little enough and therefore kept away away again west and soon depen'd to 7 fathom, which depth we kept untill 6 o'Clock having the Land just in sight from the deck - At this time the western extreme bore North distant about 4 Leagues and Seem'd to end in a point and Turn away to the northward, We took it to be P<u>oint St Augustine</u> or <u>Walsche Caep</u> / Latitude 8&deg;..24' S<sup>t</sup> Long<sup>de</sup> 22&deg;2..<sub>^</sub><sup>55' W</sup><sup>t</sup>. We now shortend sail and hauld of <small>SSW</small> and <small>SBW</small> having the wind at <small>SE</small> and <small>SEBE</small> a gentle breeze &nbsp;&nbsp;we stood off 16 miles having from 7 to 27 fathom deepening gradually as we run off - At Midnight we Tack'd and stood in untill daylight, at which time we could see no land and yet we had only 5<small>1/2</small> fathom water. We now steered <small>NW</small> having the same depth of water untill near 9 oClock when we began to deepen our water <strike>from</strike> to 6<small>1/2</small> and 7 fathom, by this I thought that we were far enough to the westward of the Cape and might haul to the northward with safety which we now did having the wind at <small>NEBE</small> a light breeze

        by noon we had increased our water to 9 fathom and were by observation in the Latitude of 8&deg;..10' S<sup>t</sup> which was 10 Miles to the Northward of that given by the Log by which I conjecter'd that we had met with a strong Current seting round the Cape not only to the Northward but to the Westward also, otherwise we ought to have seen the land which we did not
