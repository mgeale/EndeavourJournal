At 5 oClock it fixed at <small>WSW</small> and soon blowed so hard as to put us past our topsails, and to split the fore sail all to pieces: after geting another to the yard we continued standing to the southward under two Courses. At I <small>AM</small> the wind moderating set the topsails with one reef out; but soon after day light the Gale increased to a Storm with heavy squalls attended with rain &nbsp;this brought us again under our courses, and the Main topsail being split we unbent it and brought another to the yard. At 6 oClock the souther most land in sight bore <small>WBN</small> and Cape Saunders bore <small>NBW</small> distant <strike>six</strike> <sup>eight</sup> Leagues &nbsp;At Noon it bore N 20&deg; W<sup>t</sup> distant 14 Leagues; Lat<sup>de</sup> Ob<sup>d</sup> 46&deg;.. 3<strike>5</strike>6'
