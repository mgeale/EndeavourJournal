        Tuesday 12<sup>th</sup> Fortunatly we had little <sub>^</sub><sup>wind</sup> fine weather and a smooth Sea all these 24 hours, which in the <small>PM</small> gave us an oppertunity to carry out the two bower Anchors &nbsp;the one on the Starboard quarter and the other right a stern- got blocks and tackles upon the Cables <strike>and</strike> brought the falls in a baft and hove taught- &nbsp;by this time it was 5 oClock in the <small>PM</small>, the tide we observed now begun to rise, and the leak increased upon <sub>^</sub><sup>us</sup> which obliged us to set the 3<sup>rd</sup> Pump to work as we should have done the 4<sup>th</sup> also but could not make it work &#151;

        At 9 oClock the Ship righted and the leak gaind upon the Pumps considerably&#135; &nbsp;however I resolv'd to resk all and heave her off in case it was &#151; practical and accordingly turnd as many hands to the Capstan &amp; windlass as could be spared from the Pumps and about 20' past 10 <sub>^</sub><sup>oClock</sup> the Ship floated and we hove her into deep water having at this time 3 feet 9 Inches water in the hold - <sub>^</sub><sup>This done I</sup> sent the Long boat to <strike>weigh</strike> <sub>^</sub><sup>take up</sup> the stream anchor - got the Anchor but lost the Cable among the rocks, after this turn'd all hands to the Pumps the leak increasing upon us.&#134; <strike>but</strike> before 8 oClock in the <strike> <small>AM</small></strike> <sup>Morn^<sup>i</sup>ng they</sup> <strike>the pumps</strike> gain'd <sub>^</sub><sup>considerably</sup> upon the leak. <strike>In the Morning</strike> <sub>^</sub><sup>We now</sup> hove up the best bower but found it impossible to save the small bower so cut it away at a whole Cable - got up the fore topmast and fore yard warped the Ship to the <small>SE</small> and at a 11 got under Sail and Stood in for the land with a light breeze at <small>ESE</small> some hands employ'd sewing ockam wool &amp;C<sup>a</sup> into a lower Studding sail to fother the Ship. others emplo'd at the Pumps which still gain'd upon the leak &#151;
