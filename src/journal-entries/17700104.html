        Thursday 4<sup>th</sup> Winds at <small>SW</small> and <small>SWBS</small> mostly a fresh gale accompanied with a rowling sea from the same quarter. Being desirous of taking as near a View of the Coast as we could with safty, we kept edgeing in for it untill 7 oClock <small>PM</small>, being at this time 6 Leagues from the Land, we then haul'd our wind to <small>S.E.</small> and kept on that course close upon the wind all night sounding several times but had no ground with 100 and 110 fathoms &#151;

        At 8 oClock <small>AM</small> was about 5 Leagues from the land and a place <sub>^</sub><sup>which lies in the Lat<sup>d</sup> of 36&deg; 25'</sup> that had the appearence of a Bay or inlet bore East. In order to see more of this place we kept on our Course untill a 11 oClock when we <strike>was</strike> <sup>were</sup> not above 3 Leagues from it and then found that it was neither a Bay nor inlet, but low land bounded on each side by higher lands which caused the deception. At this time we tack'd and stood to the <small>N.W.</small> At Noon <strike>was</strike> <sub>^</sub><sup>we were</sup> between 3 and 4 Leagues from the land and in the Latitude of 36&deg;..31' and Long<sup>d</sup> 185&deg;..50' West. <strike>the West part of the North</strike> Cape <sub>^</sub><sup>Maria Vandiemen</sup> bore N. 25&deg; West Distant 44<small>1/2</small> Leag<sup>s</sup> from this I form my judgment of the deriction of this Coast which is nearly <small>SSE<small>3/4</small>E</small> <sub>^</sub><sup>and <small>NNW<small>3/4</small>W</small> and must</sup> <strike>and appears to be</strike> nearly a strait Shore, <strike>except to the southward of the northward of the north Cape where the land takes a more Easterly and westerly direction and by that means must form a bending in the length</strike>. In about the Latitude 35&deg;..45' is some high land adjoining to the sea. &nbsp;&nbsp;to the Southward of that the land is of a Moderate height and wears a most desolate and inhospitable aspect, nothing is to be seen but large Sand hills with hardly any green thing up[on] them and the great sea which the prevailing westerly winds impell upon the Shore must render this a very dangerous Coast, this I am so fully sencible of that was we once clear of it I am determined not to come so near again if I can possible avoide it unless we have a very favourable wind indeed &#151;
