        Saturday 17<sup>th</sup> <small>PM</small> stood to the Southward for the land above mentioned, with the wind at north a fresh breeze and clear weather. At 8 oClock we had run a 11 Leagues sence noon when the land extended from <small>SWBW</small> to <small>NBW</small> being distant from the nearest shore about 3 or 4 Leagues, in this situation <sub>^</sub><sup>had</sup> 50 fathom water a fine sandy bottom. Soon after this it fell little wind with calms and continued so until 6 oClock <small>AM</small> when a light breeze sprung up at <small>NW</small> which afterwards Veer'd to <small>NE</small>. At sun rise, being very clear, we plainly discoverd that the last mentioned land was an Island by seeing part of the Land of <u>Tovy-poenammu</u> open to the westward of it extending as far as <small>WBS</small> -

        At 8 oClock the extremes of the Island bore N 76&deg; W<sup>t</sup> and <small>NNE<small>1/2</small>E</small> and an opening that had the appearence of a Bay or Harbour, lying near the South point, N 20&deg; West distant 3 or 4 Leagues, being in 38 fathom water a brown sandy bottom. This Island <sub>^</sub><sup>which I have named after M<sup>r</sup> Banks</sup> lies about <strike>4</strike> <sup>5</sup> Leagues from the Coast of <strike>Tovy-poenammu</strike>, the south point bears S<sup>o</sup> 21&deg; West from the highest peek on the <sub>^</sub><sup>Snowey</sup> mountain<strike>s</strike> <strike>of that land</strike> <sub>^</sub><sup>so often mentioned</sup> and lies in the Latitude of 43&deg;..52' South and in the Longitude of 186&deg;.30 West by observations made of the Sun and Moon this morning. It is of a circular figure and may be about 24 Leag<sup>s</sup> in compass, the land is of a height sufficient to be seen 12 or 15 Leagues and of a very broken uneven surface, and hath more the appearence of barrenness than fertillity. Last night we saw smook upon it <sub>^</sub><sup>and this morning some people</sup> and therefore must be inhabited &#151;<br> __________________________________________________________________________________________

        Yesterday Lieutenant Gore having the morning watch at the time we first saw this Island, thought he saw land bearing <small>SSE</small> and <small>SEBE</small> but I who was upon deck at the same time was very certain that it was only Clowds which dissipated as the Sun rose, but neither this nor the runing 14 Leagues to the South, nor the seeing no land to the Eastward of us in the Evening, could satisfy M<sup>r</sup> Gore but what he saw in the morning was <strike>land</strike> or might be land altho there was hardly a possibillity of its being so because we must have been more than double the distance from it <strike>yester morning</strike> <sup>at that time</sup> to what we <strike>was</strike> were either last night or this morning at both of which times the weather was exceeding clear and yet we could see no land either to the Eastward or Southward of us. Notwithstanding all this M<sup>r</sup> Gore was of the same opinion this morning; Upon this I order'd the Ship to be wore and to be steer'd <small>ESE</small> by Compass on the other Tack, the point on <sub>^</sub><sup>which</sup> he said the land bore at this time from us. At Noon <strike>was</strike> <sup>we were </sup>in the Latitude of 44&deg;.7' S<sup>o</sup> the South point of <strike>the</strike> <u>Banks's</u> <u>Island</u> bore North distant 5 Leagues
