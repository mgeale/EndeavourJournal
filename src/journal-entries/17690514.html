        Sunday 14<sup>th</sup> This day we perform'd divine Service in one of the Tents in the Fort, where several of the Natives attended and behaved with great decency the whole time: this day closed with an odd Scene at the Gate of the Fort where a young Fellow above 6 feet high lay with a <sub>^</sub> <sup>little</sup> Girl about 10 or 12 years of age publickly before several of our people and a number of the Natives. What makes me mention this, is because, <strike>that</strike> it appear'd to be done more from Custom than Lewdness, for there were several Women present particularly Obarea and several others of the better sort and these were so far from shewing the least disapprobation that they instructed the girl how she should act her part, who young as she was, did not seem to want it.
