        Wednesday 2<sup>d</sup> Between 3 and 4 oClock in the <sup>PM</sup> we returnd out of the Country and after dinner went a shore to the watering place where we had not been long before 17 or 18 of the natives appear'd in sight, in the morning I had sent M<sup>r</sup> Gore with a boat up to the head of the bay to dridge for oysters &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in his return to the ship he and a nother person came by land and met with these people who follow'd him at the distance of 10 or 20 yards &nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>when ever Mr Gore made a Stand and face'd them they s[t]ood also</sup> and not withstanding they were all arm'd they never offerd to attack him but after he had parted from them and they were met by D<sup>r</sup> Munkhouse and one or two more who upon makeing a sham retreat they throw'd 3 darts after them, after which the[y] began to retire &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D<sup>r</sup> Solander, I, and Tupia made all the haste we could after them but could by neither words nor actions prevail upon them to come near us. M<sup>r</sup> Gore saw some <sub>^</sub><sup>up the bay</sup> who by signs invited him a shore which he prudantly declined &#151;

        In the <sup>AM</sup> had the wind at <sup>SE</sup> with rain which prevented me from makeing an excursion up the head of the bay as I intended
